The restaurant was clean, and the servers were very friendly and attentive. My sandwich (meatball) was served promptly and was very fresh and hot. The wheat bread was awesome. They have one of the new pop machines that lets you pick from several dozen flavors. The variety of subs leans to the healthy side. They have only white and wheat bread. There is a slight bit of uniqueness to their subs, but mostly they are pretty standard (more like Subway than like Which Wich). I think the price for a medium sub and drink is a bit high: $9.

Heard about how they steamed their meats so let's go ahead and try it.

Have to admit first impression wasn't great. When I walked back to the car I noticed there was water dripping from the bag! That must have come from the steaming of the meat. Luckily I caught it before I made a mess of myself.

I ordered the Firehouse Hero (Roast Beef/Turkey/Ham) which was one of the Specialty subs. There was a substantial amount of meat and the sub roll wasn't soggy like I expected to be. If you are hungry get a sub at Firehouse. I was feeling lethargic after finishing the sandwich.

Also interesting was the Coke Freestyle machine they used to serve soft drinks. You can choose from 100+ selections. I always get bored w/ the standard fountain drinks so the Freestyle machine worked great. Ended up getting a Diet Vanilla Root Beer.

Final Verdict: Steaming of the meats did bring out more flavor, and it didn't make a mess of the sub. And I might go back just to get a special soft drink.",12/4/2012 16:33

You are ordering an Italian combo combo with fries and a drink.  Furthermore, you are ordering a sub - not a hero, a hoagie or a grinder.  All sandwiches seem to be modeled on the subway franchise, a derogatory form of sandwich, from which the term derives.  

Firehouse is a kitschy place.  Everything is themed out with menu items and additional offerings being related to firehouses, firefighters, fire or heat.  The collection of hot sauces for your use earns this place a star all on it's own.  That doesn't leave much for their sandwiches though.  

All I can say is my sandwich, which should have had a bit of spice, was somehow sweet.  It was also soggy, lacking meat, and made with the inferior bread that seems so popular in the area.  It's such a shame the sandwiches aren't worth eating, they made it easy to donate to a good cause.

I went to the front and asked how much longer it would be for my meal -- and they looked at me like I was crazy. The person who took my order at the register acted like he didn't know what I was talking about. I took out my receipt and showed it to them. However it happened, my order got ""lost."" One of the staff members even commented that I had been waiting for awhile - ummm, you think? I appreciated that they made my sandwich in record time, but just was not impressed with the customer service here. Very slow for everyone all around, not good when you have a lot of people coming in for their lunch break.",8/22/2019 15:53

Since this sandwich is no longer on the menu, but's it's the only sandwich I've ever eaten, for years, mind you, I decided to call prior to placing my Uber Eats order. 

When I called, I spoke with a very kind, informative and thorough employee named Manuela. She is awesome!

Manuela told me exactly what I needed to do to order the Engine Company speciality sub, which, for all intents and purposes, is technically on their ""secret menu"". 

Clearly, I'm super, duper (sometimes ridiculously) picky, so, naturally, I called after following Manuela's instructions ""to a T"". She answered, confirmed my order, and it's on its way. 

There's a first time for everything. I've never written a Yelp review based off phone service, alone. However, I am a Pranic Energy Healer, and the Queen of Manifestation. Given the former and latter, coupled with the awesome A-One service Manuela provided, I am confident that my 5-star rating will be exactly that! Actually, bc of Manuela's customer service, I'd go so far as to say that 1. She should DEF, if not already, be the manager/get a promotion. Period. So many people who are employed in the service industry are rude. They don't like their job(s), and it shows. Manuela has great energy, and was happy to help me. That's what matters most. Yes, we sign up for Firehouse bc of the way it tastes. However, personally, if I call and the employees are rude, it's a wrap. I'm good, and on to my next choice. 

Any who, excited to receive my ""secret menu"" sub!",8/5/2020 18:07

It was a odd time of the day so I didn't expect a crowd.  There were a few folks in eating.  The place was bright and spotless.  I was greeted right away.  I asked the sandwich chef what to try in order to have a good first opinion.  I ordered a Smokehouse Beef and Cheddar Brisket.  Made it a combo with Sun Chips and a drink.

The drink machine was interesting.  Only one spot to get drinks and ice.  The touch screen allowed me to choose whatever flavors I wanted and how much of each.

The sandwich was brought out to my table rather quick.  And it was good.  I had to take smaller bites in order to make the sandwich last.  It wasn't as filling as a Subway or Quiznos but then again the bread wasn't the star of this sandwich - the cheese and brisket was.

When I was done and went in to store for my last refill and drop off my trash one of the employees reminded me that completing a survey would get me a free 32 oz drink next time.  Not a bad deal since (A) I had good things to say and (b) I knew I would be back.",7/30/2013 0:50

Ordering was painless, their menu was a little hard to see from passenger sides. The lane splits into two probably to prevent long lines but it bottlenecks at a weird spot so people got stuck in the single line anyway, since everyone here has trucks or SUVs.

It took them three minutes to take our payment. No one came to the window in that duration. Doesn't seem that long? Well it's a drive thru! People go through because they probably came for their lunch break and needed something quick. The minutes add up! Then after the payment it took them another 18 minutes to give us our sandwiches. We were the only one in the drive thru, by the time we got the three sandwiches we ordered, a whole line gathered behind us. From what I could see, there were plenty of staff but they didn't seem to be in any particular rush. They didn't even try to address the wait time. No apologies. Not to mention the person who handed us the bag still had the gloves they were wearing to presumably make sandwiches! The whole top half of the bag was covered in... I don't even know! I saw them hiring far before opening day. There's a bit of an expectation for them to be working harder for at least the first *week* of opening.

I was excited because not a lot of sandwich places have drive thrus but for a quick meal meal I should have stuck to Cane's. Pretty sure I could have ordered a sandwich at Subway and gotten it way faster. At least then I would have gotten what I paid for. Fast, inexpensive and mediocre at Subway vs slow, expensive and slightly better than lunch meat from a deli at Firehouse Subs.

I had already packed the hubby's chips in his lunch, with no sandwich! Told him I'd drop off a surprise.

I ordered two small steam rollers(?), and two chili's.

I was kidding when I asked if they were opening a shop in south Reno... but he said ""yes we are""!!!!!

I had them bag the sandwich and chili into two separate bags and dropped off the hubby's lunch (curbside) to his office.

I went with the hero sub. It had roast beef ham and turkey on it. The sauce they used was a little on the Sweetside, almost like they used miracle whip instead of mayonnaise. It was quite tasty. The only thing I could say is for $13, wish it had more meat on it. $13 for sandwiches quite a bit. It tasted really good for sure. 

The service was definitely friendly. And I do like them having a drive-through for convenience. I would have to say it's probably one of the best subs around, just a little pricey.

I miss going to Firehouse. 

It's been  two years since my last visit  (back in California)!

I parked off to the side, because I noticed there was a sign for a drive-thru. I noticed three or four cars pull up.

I couldn't remember what sandwich I liked, but took a chance and pulled up.

Luckily they have a very nice clear menu, and when I saw my sandwich ""the steamer"", I knew it was mine.

Perfect offering of sizes, so I just got the small, with chips and a medium drink. The medium was really big.

Service was a little slow, but hey it's lunch time and three cars ahead of me, so no problem. I can take more pics!

I'm not sure why, but I really like how they make their sandwiches! Perfect bread and not stringy corn beef/pastrami. 

Plus I don't mind rounding up my bill to help their organization.

I'll be back in three weeks for my next appointment and I will plan on stopping for lunch.

The locations a little goofy since the building used to be a bank so the parking situation is odd but that's not a problem.

The place is always clean and super bright. Fun decor throughout and the staff is always smiling and jolly. Never a long wait.

A special huge shout out to Nikki. When we were there today it was crazy busy and the soda machine went down. Nikki has to deal with two very rude customers while she ran around delivering food and her smile. I would have punched those rude customers but Nikki handled it very well. Kudos!

Now for the best part. The fooooood! Awesome sandwiches each and every time. You can get soup, chili or chips for the side instead of chips.

Came here with my brother for a dinner on a random weekday night. The place was for the most part empty and maybe had 6 other ppl sitting. I normally stick with the Meatball (sweet and spicy) or the BBQ Brisket but this time walking in I noticed that they had just released a new sandwich the Spicy Cajun Chicken and deuces to give that a chance while by brother stuck with the consistent Meatball. The service for how empty the place was wayyy to long (especially compared to The Carson location) but the Spicy Cajun Chicken made up for the wait and then some as it was absolutely delicious.

They were made carefully so that they weren't falling apart and they didn't fall apart at any time so already that's good compared to some sandwich places. I've had a few different sandwiches and all of them tasted great. The only complaint I have with the food is with the pickle. Although the pickle tasted alright it didn't seem as fresh as it should have been. It comes wrapped up in a small plastic bag and it seems to me like they wrap a bunch of them up all at once and they are stored for a period of time individually wrapped. Not that big of a deal but it's the only complaint I could think of regarding the food. The delivery's were placed through Door Dash so I can't fault them in any way for the delivery time and as far as the pick up order situation goes, they were very professional and clean. They practiced 'social distancing' and required a mask while waiting for the food so that was a plus for me.

I was super impressed with how smoothly everything was operating within their first few days being open. Everyone was confidently operating as a well oiled machine.

Aside from that pressure to evaluate when we just took a bite, the food was good and service was great.

Subsequent visits have been through drive through or ordered to-go, so the evaluation pressure may have dwindled since opening week.  The food is consistent and service is always friendly! I also love the freshness of their salads!

I have never been here before and was excited to hear it open since I've passed by it in Vegas.

I tried ordering online and mobile, but my order didn't go through, no biggie. I'll just order when I get there - it was the lunch rush, nooooo. I wouldn't recommend coming here during the lunch rush since it took around 20 minutes to get my sandwich from when I ordered. Most of the tables were taken too! Anyways, I got a medium Hook & Ladder on wheat.

While waiting I helped myself to their sauce selection, definitely try their Datil Pepper Sauce! It was sweet and slightly spicy, but not too much. It complimented my sub well~

I didn't get to eat it until I drove back to work, but the hot sub held up well on the ~20 minute drive back. I devoured my half of the medium and was pretty satisfied. Will definitely be back to try their current special of a $5.55 medium Spicy Cajun Chicken!",2/7/2019 21:38

Instead, all ""tips"" are donated to a charity, which is a nice touch. Lastly, my sandwich was neatly placed in a cardboard to-go box, which is so much better than a styrofoam. I wish every restaurant did this!
Alas, this is where my compliments end. 
They made so many mistakes on my sub that it's unforgivable and have permanently lost a customer. I would like to note that I ordered my sub during the lunch rush, so some of the mistakes are undertstable. 

Below are the list of mistakes Firehouse subs made, beginning with the worst: 

1. They forgot to include the steak in my ""Steak & Cheese"" sub!?!
Just let that sink in...
I didn't confirm this until I started to eat the second half for two reasons: (a) I was famished so I inhaled the first half. (b) The sandwich was filled with so so many veggies - pepperoncinis, bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, and onions - to the point where I could taste nothing else. It was even difficult to taste the cheese!
2. There were so many veggies the sandwich became too messy for comfort. I had to wash my hand after eating this. 
3. I asked for no mushrooms and lo & behold, there were mushrooms. 
4. I asked for my sub on white bread and... you guessed it (or looked at my photo)! My sub came with wheat bread. 

Individually these mistakes (except for #1) are forgivable, but all together I cannot be convinced to come back.",5/8/2019 22:00

I don't feel I had to wait too long to order, but it did seem to take awhile for the person ahead of me to get their order. Maybe it was a large order? The gentleman working the drive thru was very friendly. It did take a little while to get my order as well. I ordered an Engineer (Smoked turkey breast, melted Swiss, and sautéed mushrooms), a Firehouse Hero (USDA Choice roast beef, smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham, and melted provolone), a bowl of chili (our favorite!), and two large drinks.

We also signed in on their app so we were able to get a free large drink with the purchase of a sub.
 The staff member was really helpful and told us what came on our sandwiches. The service was really quick and we were able to get our sandwiches delivered to our table in under 10 minutes. The Cajun chicken sub had really good spicy flavor with the Cajun seasoning and pepper jack cheese. The steak and mushroom was really good but the next time I get this sandwich I would like it a little more spicy and probably order it with pepper jack cheese. The meatball sub was cheesy, gooey, and delicious. For our drinks we decided to get there cherry limeade. We tried it both sparkling and original and we decided that we liked the sparkling better.

There's so many different combinations and flavors you could make - I usually never ever drink soda but I couldn't resist because it was so awesome. 

The food came out pretty fast and the staff was very polite. I wish they had more bread choices than white or wheat but the white bread was nice and crispy from being heated but still soft on the inside - my favorite. The sandwich was a good size, longer than a 6 inch but smaller than a footlong - however you could go bigger if you wanted.

When we first arrived, I told the girl I hadn't been to a firehouse before and I needed a few minutes to look. There weren't any other customers trying to order, so I expected at least a smile or something- but she just rudely turned around like I was a bother. Then I told my fiancé that I'm going to try to steak and cheese. Anyways a polite guy behind the counter overheard and started making my sub. The girl was like ""no- you order here"" um hey. You work at Firehouse in customer service. Act like it. 

Anyways, the entire ordering process was painful. The food arrived, and the pain of dealing with Ms Attitude disappeared when I tried my sandwich. That was a good damn sandwich! The brownie was fine, nothing to write home about. 

I'll give them another shot at some point, but I would have a talk with my employees about how to treat customers. There are plenty of places to eat in Brandon, I won't go out of my way for poor customer service.",4/21/2018 1:06

First off the bread is horrible, and the sauce that they put on everything is not good. but the sandwiches do have a good amount of meats and are tasty in that respect. they toast the bread which I like sometimes, i just think the bread could be alot better.

And maybe its just me but i find it annoying when i walk into a place of business and every single employee turns to you and yells ""welcome to Firehouse"" then when you leave they all have to yell goodbye. I understand being friendly but come on, the only thing worse is when you go to eat and the waiter or waitress sits at your table to take your order.

Today the timing was right. I was going to stop, grab a sub to take home and watch some football.
I drove the ten minutes home and... they had put so much mayo, wet lettuce and vinegar on the sub the bottom slice of bread was completely soaked through. I couldn't even pick it up out of the box.
The service wasn't great either. They person taking my order simply assumed i wanted EVERYTHING on it and never asked me what I wanted on it. I luckily asked if I had to tell the sandwich makers what I wanted on it like at Jersey Mike's... that's when he told me no, I had to tell him (I had already paid by this time).
Wouldn't you simply point to all the toppings and confirm ""Hey is everything here ok on your sub?"" Maybe that's just me tho.

Let's be honest, turkey sandwiches are my 2nd favorite food, and as long as the meat is not nasty quality (I'm looking at you, Subway), I'm game. Quizno's, Which Wich, and Firehouse rank in my top 3, not in any particular order. Around here, we have more Firehouse than the rest, so I get to indulge often. 

Pros: steaming hot, super fresh. The turkey is smoked, which is usually not my fave but I love it here. They donate a portion of sales to local fire/police/EMS (for example, over $2.5 million to Florida first responders and public safety in April of 2015). I think they also give a discount to uniformed public safety workers (although most places do).  You can call ahead or order by app to save time. There is a wide assortment of hot sauces (like 50+) to use. Also salads, chips, cookies, and a Coke Freestyle machine. Generally friendly service. Never a mistake on my order.

Cons: And these honestly only pertain to this location. Every time I come in here, the place is a mess. Dirty floors, tables, and counters. The Coke machine seems to be perpetually out of whatever I have a taste for that day. Price is a tad high for serving size. And SLOW. I realize that some of this is the nature of the beast - they don't drop the meat for your sandwich into the steamer until you order it - but I have waited over 15 minutes for a sandwich here at lunch time. Firemen ain't got no time for that! 

I have not experienced the same degree of slowness at my other 2 regular locations in North Lakeland and West Bradenton. This store, however, is always pretty busy and they always seem shorthanded, so that may account for things.

But always yummy. I put up with the wait.",8/27/2015 17:20

Also, no American cheese? Really? I'm sure I'm in the minority when I say that, but c'mon.

Late add: I wanted only the cheese on my ham sandwich. She kept saying a plain ham. I told her FOUR times I wanted only ham and cheese. I got only ham.

Perfection!

I was greeted immediately when I walked in, the cashier was ready for me to place my order right away, I didn't feel pressured to ""super size"" my sub or to add the combo.  The sandwiches can be ordered fully loaded with lettuce, tomato, mayo, mustard... or you can pick and choose what toppings to add.  The sub was then steamed and served directly to my table with perfectly melted cheese.  If you opt for the drink, there is one of those newer Coca-Cola machines that allows you to pick and choose any drink/syrup combination known to man.

While I was eating, a lady stopped in to place a large order for pick up this weekend.  The manager was super polite and explained the options in detail.  She was even able to customize the order by having the lettuce on the side instead of the sandwiches being prepared with the lettuce on them.  Mustard and mayo packets come on the side.

So it has been a while! I was in the mood for a good sandwich and being gluten free, my options are limited. After a quick yelp search, I learned of this new location and their gluten free bread options. Sold! Not 15 mins later, I was in the store placing my order. I like firehouse because they serve their sandwiches warmed with melted cheese and they have a great array of toppings to choose from. I went with the GF medium club and it did not disappoint. I added hot peppers, cherry peppers, peperocinis, and pickles to spice it up. The sandwich was about $9, gluten free bread +$2 (a little steep, but whatever), and add a combo with chips and drink +$3.50, all amounted to about $15 for lunch. It was definitely on the pricier end of lunch options but it hit the spot. The store was large and clean with plenty of employees working to move people through fast at the lunch hour.

I understand new restaurant growing pains and right now your pains are evident.  I ordered yesterday, and made two special request, light mayo and to put the chopped pickle on the side, what I received instead is a sandwich with chopped pickle on the sandwich, no dill spear and a thick coating of mayonnaise.  My spouse asked for extra tomatoes and he has a picture show 3/4 slice of tomato on his sandwich, what part of this fulfills the request of extra tomato?

The bread was tough, obviously you need to have your sub prepared as hot so they steam the bun otherwise it is not that good.  I ordered the sandwich cold purposely  as I do not like the soggy condition of a steamed sub.  

By the way there is no way to let Corporate know how disappointed with the product as the Reno store is not listed, so really this is the only way to let you know that the sub was ""MEH"" and you have a long way to go.  In a town that has good alternatives, I urge your staff to PAY ATTENTION to the order and make it right or risk future patronage.  My visit was at 6:15 PM on Wednesday, May 20, 2020.  The store was empty and hardly busy so your staff cannot claim they were ""rushed"" to make my order.  I plan to order again,  everyplace can have a bad day, but when you are new in Reno and you want to make a good impression, the impression you left was MEH!  

On the corporate side, your app is poor and buggy, we tried to order this past Saturday and I could,  but my spouse who actually likes you and has had the app for awhile could not, so there was a lost business opportunity.  I lost my first user reward for signing up as well because I was not going to a place where I could order but my spouse could not.  These are easy errors to fix why did you make it so difficult?  Maybe it was warning sign to expect disappointment.",5/21/2020 15:53

He had the beef brisket & cheddar and I had the Italian. Two options for bread, white or wheat, and two options for sizes - 8 inch or 12 inch. My husband had the 12 inch and said if he did it again, he'd get double meat on the 8 inch - the meat was great, there just wasn't enough for him. I had a taste- very tender & flavorful! I liked mine, I kept it with the same toppings that come on it but said no to the spicy mustard - I figured Italian dressing & mayo was enough. My mistake. It was little too sweet for my liking so I went to get the banana peppers to add to it after I took a couple bites. That did the trick. 

Two things I liked: you get a pickle with every sandwich and they have one of the fancy ""Freestyle"" computerized coke machines. I've never used one before and it was kind of fun! You can add a flavor to any kind of drink, so you can have Strawberry Sprite Zero for example. Or Cherry Vanilla Coke Zero. I would definitely return for the drinks, I loved the strawberry lemonade! 

The only negative for us was the chip selection. They had Sunships, some Lays and Mrs Vickers but no BBQ flavored chips for my husband and no salt & vinegar chips for me. :( But we were full without chips so not that big of a deal I guess... I will just go to Jimmy John's when I need delicious chips to go with my sandwich! :)",1/30/2012 1:07

I didn't think the sub would actually be spicy as most sub sandwich shops advertise spicy, but just don't deliver.  Well, this spicy meatball sub certainly delivered the tangy taste and I really enjoyed it.  If you want extra heat, the restaurant offers several bottles of hot sauce from mild to oh my god, that is burning my tongue hot.

The cashier messed it up and put $60 in the computer instead of $30. 2 other employees were trying to help and it took forever for the 3 of them to figure out how to refund and re ring the order. Finally 1 employee tried to refund me $29 instead of $30. At that point I was feeling very uncomfortable and I was really  wanting to just get my $30 and get out of there but they got it figured out eventually. As I waited for the food it looked like other people were having issues too at the register. I don't think I'll be going back to that location again though.

Jersey Mike's used to have my favorite Italian, but after receiving one really substandard sandwich there and their steep price increase, I now prefer Firehouse.

The steamed bread, piles of Italian cold cuts, veggies and dressing combine to make an Italian sub I crave.

A bit pricey at $10 and change, but the taste and quality makes it worth it for me.

That is untill the next people got the same welcome and I started to understand after 5 minutes of being in there why those other 2 people looked like they hated the thought of anyone else walking in.

 Now, we got past the welcome committee so let's get the on to the food. I know that a sandwich is just a sadwich but his my friends is a sub and it's a sub that's done well. I had the turkey and mushroom with everything except olives cause, i hate olives. This is way up on the fast food scale. As of right now I am hooked on this place. The wheat bread is awesome and the sandwich just has a flavor that's just freaking good.

I can understand this during busy hours but this was 4:30 in the afternoon and I was the only customer. The fountain drink station had fresh limes cut up but they were covered in brown spots and very unappetizing. And the drinks had a funky taste to them too. Almost like they had a bad water supply.

Price was well-suited to the portions. My large sub was the same size and price as a premium footlong at that ""other"" sub place but 10 times better. The signature pepper sauce was delicious. 

The service was fantastic. Despite the fact that nearly every table was full, we had our order within just a few minutes. And when I went up a couple minutes later to ask a question, my server remembered and called me by name from when I had ordered 10 minutes earlier. Service was very friendly and helpful.

I have never heard anyone so enthusiastic about a sandwich before.   My Dad and I tried it today (and took home a meatball sub for hubby).  She was right!

Upon entering, we explained that we hadn't been in before and they let us have a little taste of the brisket and the corned beef so we could decide what to get.   As much as we love corned beef, there was something about the moist, smoky brisket that I just had to have.   We got a large combo and split it.   It was more than enough sandwich for the both of us for lunch.

I can't say enough good things about the friendly, helpful staff.   Chris, the cashier, was awesome, as was the Assistant Manager with the cute pixie haircut.   They let me pay for hubby's meatball sub with our sit-down meal  (so I didn't have to wait in line again) and then make it when we were ready to leave so it arrived at home fresher.

We were surprised how busy they were today -- but everyone got greeted and the tables were kept clean.   We had a really nice experience and we'll continue to get sandwiches here for sure.

First trip to Firehouse Subs; thought I'd try something different.  Ordered the Hook n' Ladder and The Hero.  Was asked if I wanted the pickle on the side (that it's supposed to come with).  Paid my money.  Sat down and waited for my to-go order.

I supposed Jimmy Johns has spoiled me because I waited longer than I expected with the three employees working.  While waiting, I noticed the place had a hot sauce selection for customer use.  For those who don't know, I'm a HUGE sucker for hot sauce.  Because my order was to-go, I passed but I love me some hot sauce.

Received my two subs and bailed as planned.  When I got home, to my dismay, we had no pickles!!!  WTF!?!?!?  Don't tell me I'm getting pickles when you don't include them.  That was Strike One.

Still upset, I began eating my sub.  My overall impression was that the employee who made my sub put all the ingredients in a blender and once all combined, dumped the concoction onto some sub sandwich bread and gave it to me.

I really want to give this place a second chance but when a place asks me if I want something, I say yes, then the place neglects to give me what I ask for, I have a really hard time with the second chance.  We'll see........",4/19/2014 3:01

Firehouse had exactly what I was looking for.  

They are definitely a fast-food, large chain style sub sandwich joint--that said, I think they are one of the better fast-food, large-chain sub sandwich joints.  I ordered their medium ""engineer"" sub combo.  The sub had smoked turkey, swiss, and sauteed mushrooms.  It came with a soda and a bag of chips. Our sandwiches were brought to our table piping hot and they have the self-serve Coca-Cola freestyle fountain beverage machine (which is just plain cool--I got a diet cherry coke--which isn't that unusual but, for some reason, still reminded me of childhood trips to 7-11 where I would get a coke slurpee with just a touch of cherry slurpee added--it's the little things that tend to delight me).  The service was quite friendly and efficient.  The atmosphere is a little visually loud but seemed to be appreciated by the kiddo in our group.

I get a medium smoked turkey and cheese sandwich and the Italian salad.  The Italian salad isn't just any boring salad. This salad packs a punch with flavor and dressing.

My niece and nephew get a half sandwich with the mac & cheese. They absolutely love this new option. The mac & cheese has a breading on top to give it a little bit of crunch and additional flavor and it is super tasty!

Looking at the menu, that has great pictures and calorie content, it was very hard to decide! There are a lot of great options and even a low calorie section. We placed our order, the price was very reasonable. They asked if we wanted to round up to support the fire stations.. Of course! We went to grab our drinks from the soda fountain (which has every option you can imagine) and by the time we sat down the guy was coming to our table with hot sandwiches!

Whenever we go INSIDE this location to eat,  the food is always great quality. Whenever we DoorDash (which is how we have ordered the last few times), it's like the staff doesn't even read the order and we end up with sammies that are nothing like we ordered. 

Today I went in to talk to someone about our latest DoorDash order and the 50's/60's man I spoke to became somewhat rude pretty quickly. I started to show him photos of the sandwiches we received two nights ago and he stopped me cold saying he didn't need to see the photos, that he was only interested in fixing the problem. He also made a comment about not understanding why the orders are right when we come in but not when we DoorDash.  I agreed that I don't know why either. ‍ I get that he wanted to move forward from an order gone wrong but he had no interest at all in seeing the proof of the poor quality food we received. If it was my place of business, I would be interested in the quality of the product going out the door even when I'm not there. 

He gave us coupons for free medium subs for future visits but he could use some lessons in showing interest in customer complaints. I am not someone to go into a place of business ranting and making a scene or being rude and I did not do it this time either but that is how I was treated. I was not impressed with the way I was treated by this employee/manager/owner or whoever it was I spoke with.

When I first walked in I was greeted by 2 employees with a very nice welcome. There is no rush to order and everyone is willing to answer questions.

The menu is better than other sub shops. I ordered the meatball sub. The size options are 8 or  12 inches. Bread options are white or wheat. The subs are all toasted which I like.  

Their options are pretty interesting, good mix of ingredients and the flavors are pretty bold.

My favorite part of this shop is all the hot sauces at the end if the bar!! 30 plus different hot sauces that you can put in your sub!  

They also collect spare change, donations, and sell their old pickle buckets in support of local first responders. A very cool place.",10/18/2013 2:18

There is a nice variety of sandwiches from which to choose, or you can create your own sub.  For only $2.99 you can make it a combo and have chips and a pretty large drink.  The subs are toasted which in my mind makes them perfect.

If I went along with that opinion, this Firehouse would rate a one star!

My visit yesterday was not at all up to expectations and I certainly did not get what I expected.  It was my second visit in two weeks.  The first time, my Italian sub tasted fantastic, though I was a little surprised that it was just barely warm.  Yesterday, I asked for it to be cold.  Note:  for those not familiar with Firehouse;  they only have one cold sub, the tuna salad.  All others are hot, but you can ask that they make any of them cold.
While my Italian sub two weeks ago tasted great, with a pronounced Italian flavor and beautifully made, with the meats and cheese nicely layered and spread out over the bread, today's was completely different.  It was on stale bread, the meat kind of thrown on it, with the ham balled up into pieces.  No Italian taste whatsoever.  Couldn't really tell if it was just a ham sub or what, but definitely not Italian.  I had ordered an Italian, and the receipt says it was, but no.  It wasn't.  A big disappointment, and at $19.99 for it and another sandwich, way overpriced.  Subway, at $4.99 each, for they're specials...a much better deal.
The second sandwich, meatball, was ok, by my wife's comments, though at almost ten dollars, way short of equal to it's price/value.

One other note; her meatball sub was wrapped and put in it's accompanying box.  For some reason, they put a pickle spear, in a little plastic baggy, under the sandwich??!!  Why?  Warm pickle spear anyone?!  And secondly, they bagged the hot meatball sub in with the cold, supposedly Italian sub.  Not a good idea.  The hot sub cools faster while the cold sub doesn't stay cold.

The place was clean, the service fairly quick and friendly.  Too bad the food did not live up to expectations.",1/31/2018 9:29

I walked in and was greeted with more than one smile and the first and most important thing I noticed was how clean it was. There was no straws or napkins or any trash on the floor. Every single chair was pushed in and lined up and even every napkin dispenser on the tables were lined up and looked orderly. The drink station was wiped down and didn't have any drops of soda on the counter and there wasn't a single straw wrapper laying around. Pretty impressed.

I ordered my sub, it came out fast and exactly as I ordered it...can't complain. While I was eating I noticed 3 different employees simultaneously cleaning and wiping down tables and seats.

It doesn't get 5 stars because the subs were phenomenal, although they are very good in my opinion, it's gets 5 stars because of how I was treated, how timely & accurate my food came out and their obvious commitment to cleanliness.",7/14/2017 22:16

I recommend it to everyone hungry. This location, first, had a guy that looked high and was REALLY SLOW. Other people that came in after me were all getting their subs made by someone quicker and were done and out. He then had to throw it away because he used the wrong bread and then the other person made it because I asked him if he was new. The other girl working kept asking him ""did they even train you?!"" I haven't seen him there since but once so I am guessing maybe he got fired? I, however, never see the same people so it is always hit or miss with the quality of the food. 

I still go there though because I love Firehouse and because it is literally 2 minutes from my house. 

Last night I went there with a friend and they took a little longer than usual to make two subs. We even called it in. We waited for it to finish and went straight home (reminder - 2 minutes) when it was done. The subs were hard and cold. I bought 5 of the lemon macadamia nut cookies which are usually totally amazing. They were hard and tasted bad; almost as if they had an old freezer burnt taste. I threw them away. Then today, my partner and I have had some serious upset stomachs. 

I'm really sad about it because Firehouse to me is like going to a families restaurant. I get even sadder when they forget to put my pickle in the bag (every time). Knowing me I am still going to go there, though, mainly because I love their subs.

Before I go in next time, I'm going to get down on my knees and pray to Jesus that they're having a good day today.",11/2/2018 23:28

Overall the aesthetic is that typical American type, similar to five guys or so. Let's start with the sandwich. I got a club on a sub, but they forgot the bacon. We all know that a club is nothing without the bacon, so that was pretty disappointing, but overall the sandwich was just alright. The bread didn't have a satisfying toasted crunch, nor did it melt together in an untoasted fashion. The flavors were all just meh. Not bad, but not great either, just ok. The pepper sauce that you can get on the side was just super sweet and nothing else really. It was good, but again, not great. The Mac and cheese... Came out of a plastic baggie. I know that that's just a reality of fast food, but it's still jarring to see. The worst part though, was that it was Mac and cheese soup. It was so funny and relatively flavorless. Off you're looking for a similar flavor, I definitely recommend Panera bread's Mac. I also tried the cherry limeade that's a Firehouse special. Again, way to sweet, where is the lime part? I certainly couldn't taste it. A pretty mediocre trip overall, I probably wouldn't go out of my way to get it again.",3/12/2020 17:24

I am watching this in the parking spot in front of their business. Then I am noticing as the wife is pacing from the front of the store to the back and looking at me thru the stores front doors the group of 5 are sitting at their table all eating their subs. Went inside and this point and told the wife to get a credit card refund, employee blaming their steamer was not working. Wife makes it out after 20 minutes, the employee was having a regular conversation with the 5 friends. I guess they put us on the back burner and took care of his friends.

There isn't a veggie sub on the menu, but they made me one. The cashier had a hard time entering all the items into the ordering system, but she got it eventually with a little help from somebody else. After ordering I sat down to wait, and I realized that there were 5 or 6 other tables with people and none of them had their food. I could tell this might take a while and it did. I waited about 15 minutes before getting my sandwich and the employee actually apologized for the wait.

It was nice that he recognized that it took a long time. But still, waiting that long for a fast food sandwich is kind of bad.

As far as the sandwich goes, I don't understand why it is was so wet. Everything was falling out of the bread, and it was just a mess. I did ask for some dressing but why so much? Publix takes forever to make your sandwich too, but at least you are rewarded with a very good sandwich at the end.

I ate it and moved on with my life. I guess that about says it all. I'll stick with Jersey Mike's or Publix.",6/13/2014 14:43

First time trying this place. Got home opened styrofoam box and fly was crawling on top of meatball sandwich. I hit it with finger and it didn't fly away, just kept walking around on sandwich. Must have liked it a lot.

Okay, so it happens but I'm not about to eat the sandwich. I was in my kitchen when I opened it so I know it wasn't mine, I don't have flies. Back to the place to return it, but not getting another cause I lost my appetite.

I politely asked who manager was and took him to the side cause I didn't want everyone in the place who was eating to start throwing up. I told him I just wanted my money back. Said Okay, gave me money and said Sorry about that. That's it.

He said it so matter-of-factly that I figured it happens all the time. As I was leaving I saw another fly and there were some outside when I went out. Don't know what they can do about it, maybe pay more attention when they pack up the food that they're not rapping bugs with it.  

Wouldn't usually post something like this if the manager was a little more apologetic but he wasn't so...",5/12/2018 17:12

I usually go with the Engineer or Hook and ladder, you can't go wrong with either of these sandwiches.

This restaurant is always clean and has easy to read menu boards. You are greeted with a ""Welcome to firehouse"" when you walk in the door. Ordering is quick and easy and the subs come out relatively quick. They ask for your name to call out when you sub is ready, give them a fake one and have fun with it.

They have the uber expensive coke machine that does 250 flavors, or something like that, but not one of them taste right in my opinion. They should just go back to the old fountain machine, it's better.

They have a couple of TVs with sound if your alone at lunch and want to catch up on news or sports. Usually running bay news 9 or ESPN.

This was an easy to find store, and both gentlemen inside were friendly and accommodating.  Our order was ready, and it smelled delicious on the ride home. 

We split a large hot pastrami & delivered a kids meal to the kid next door - hot ham, drink, dessert & hat. I had to ask for the hat before leaving. It wasn't in the bag. He was thrilled with it! But he didn't know that he was supposed to get dessert - marshmallow treat. So he wasn't disappointed. But I was. No treat! I didn't call to complain because it's a 15 drive back to get it. Not worth it. Our sandwich was good. I hope he enjoyed his sandwich and his drink. 

I'll be returning to Tarpon next time I order. It's closer & they've never gotten my order wrong. I should have checked my order before leaving. Then it would be a 5 star review. But I didn't. Do check your order before you leave here, and you won't be disappointed.",3/24/2020 22:59

Our family does have some food allergies and although, they had a hard time finding the allergy guide in stores, I was able to easily locate it online. Most of the sandwiches are soy free which is a great sign for fresh food as most processed items contain soy.

Decided on a whim to try this place for lunch - 1:30 Wednesday afternoon. Wasn't busy, and the guy at the counter was very friendly. I ordered a medium Engineer on wheat,  and added banana peppers.  Guy told me right off they were out of tomatoes, so there wouldn't be any of those. OK, I can live with that - but unfortunate for a sub restaurant to run out of one of the most popular toppings ever. They only serve salads and subs, very limited menu, and can't keep tomatoes? Tons of grocery stores around, they should have picked some up.  Come on, guys! 

Got it to go - waited at a nearby table that had sticky pink soda or some kind of drink on it - yuck. Took a little less than 10 minutes for them to call my name, so I grabbed my sub and headed back to work in Maryland Farms.  Sat to eat when I got back to work - and there were zero mushrooms on my sub. Not a single one.  Though after reading another reviewer mention the mushrooms they use are canned and not fresh, well, heck, not as disappointing as I may have initially thought. Supposed to also be served with a pickle - didn't get one of those, either.  So, no tomato, no pickle, no mushrooms.  I paid more for an Engineer sub, when I could have just paid for a turkey sub, cause that's all I got. 

Also, feel it's worth mentioning that it was served in a little closeable carboard box.  IMO, just a waste of resources. What's wrong with wrapping the sub in paper? Cardboard sub box, then in a paper bag as well.  Not very eco-friendly. 

Well, since this was my first ever visit to Firehouse Subs, and they basically cannot even do their job, this was also my last visit to Firehouse Subs.  Way too many excellent places in Brentwood and Maryland Farms to grab lunch where you actually get what you order and pay for.",5/10/2018 1:34

Not only did it take a long time but they got the orders wrong, and we got the wrong sandwiches all together.

I ordered their Smokehouse Beef  & Cheese Brisket sub. It looked as good as the one pictured on their website!! It would have been nice had the cheddar cheese been allowed to melt to embrace the meat, but it didn't.  I would have liked to have had a lot more brisket, but this is not a deli. All in all, it was a tasty, filling sandwich. My wife picked my old fav, their Pastrami sub. She seemed to enjoy it down to the last bite.

I was really impressed with the level of service today. That, and the food, are the reasons that we are long time customers. My sandwich, their Smokehouse Beef & Cheese Brisket sub, was a good deli-style sandwich, but a deli sandwich it isn't.

I am not a fan of purchased sandwiches simply because they just don't live up to my standards and that is not arrogance it just reflects my specific preference.  My husband decided that he wanted a sandwich and I specifically told him that I did not. He bought me one anyway.  It was a turkey sandwich with canned mushrooms, scant lettuce, scant tomatoes mayo and turkey.  Boring!!

I like my sandwiches hot and fully dressed.  This means that the bread needs to be toasted, the meat needs to be grilled, there should be a double serving of fresh vegetables added to include leafy greens such as spinach, or green lettuce, a sharp cheddar and a shot of balsamic vinegar.  I also will occasionally add mixed peppers, cucumbers or guacamole.  I would never have canned mushrooms added to my sandwich as they are frankly disgusting.  Of course my husband is aware of my mushroom rule but simply forgot to ask if the mushrooms are fresh.  Also, as far as I know, he has only eaten two Firehouse subs over the past 20 years and is not really familiar with their practices.

Unfortunately, I am away from home and cannot access my own kitchen to make my own sandwich so I appreciated my husband's thoughtfulness.  I removed the mushrooms from the sandwich and tried it.  I found it lacking in flavor and in need of additional vegetables and seasoning.   Firehouse needs to step it way up and commit to a better quality product.

A simple ""Hi, can you give me one second"" or any kind of acknowledgment would have been appreciated. Finally, she asks what I would like, to which I order the New York Steamer( meat, cheese, mayo, mustard, and Italian dressing). Specifically, I said I'd like the New York Steamer with no mayo or mustard. While looking at the screen on my end I see New York Steamer and then an indented minus or no mayo and no mustard pop up. While I'm reading/reviewing my order it changes to New York Steamer and the line below that is indented switches to ""plain"". I then clarify with the lady taking my order "" The screen just switched to plain and I just want to clarify that I DO want Italian dressing on my sandwich just no mayo and no mustard"".

First off, the decor is spot on. The tables are spotted like dalmatians and the walls have murals reppin' UCSB. Theres also firemen costumes that customers can wear and take pictures with. 
The service was also great. Everyone was friendly and attentive. All smiles.
We shared number 10: beef brisket (smoked for 16+ hours), melted cheddar, mayo, and sweet baby ray's bbq sauce. This was seriously sandwich heaven. The brisket (to my surprise) tasted superrr fresh and the thinly cut slices made it taste even better. Seriously though, just the meat alone got me to rate this place 5 stars. To top it off, the melted cheddar with bbq sauce really blew this place away...
They also have tons have different sauce bottles to try, my fav being the jalepeno hot sauce ones!

More proof that this is the best food era, EVER for IV. Sure I miss Serranitos and the NY Hero House --but we now have more variety, price-points, and range of elegance than ever. Folks who don't live in IV ought to come here just for the dining. It's starting to remind me of the district in Paris around the Sorbonne. 

I am taking advantage of the spring break to get into IV to try out some of our newer spots. I was VERY impressed with Firehouse Subs. The place feels a little overly adorned, but it'll age well into the Isla Vista culture. 

But it is all about the food. At the suggestion of an employee, I tried the #10. I'm not an expert on brisket. But I doubt it could get much better than this. I enjoyed every bit of my seven dollar and one cent sandwich. 

I tried one of the salsas from their rack of sauces from around the world and I believe that the sun had broken it down -- it tasted a little like petroleum and vinegar. Maybe they ought to pull back on the salsa museum and further feature their own sauce--which is very, very good. 

What an excellent first experience. I'll be back to the firehouse. My message to their management--well done! Now ease up and enjoy yourself. You're getting an A.",3/25/2014 20:58

The franchise owner is often working on site, and he and his employees are always very friendly and accommodating. I don't expect I'll ever have an issue with bad service at Firehouse Subs.

Finally, the food - let me tell you it is GOOD. This is no Subway, Firehouse uses some really high quality meat in their subs. Seriously, like LA deli good.

I also created my own sandwich for him for leftovers, obviously did not ask for mayo.

Both times, two minutes later this Firehouse Subs location would cancel the order and the email explanation I got both times from GrubHub was that they are no longer accepting delivery orders?  I get when it's fifteen minutes before closing time, but over an hour before closing time?  I am curious if they lock the doors an hour before closing time.  Either way as someone who worked in food service for years and never stopped taking delivery orders until fifteen minutes (or 30 minutes at the most), I just don't understand why they can't make one sandwich for delivery with over an hour to go... I'm not saying it's a bunch of lazy teenagers just waiting to clock out and so they stop doing their job an hour before closing, but it is sure what it feels like.

That still stands today. I will take Firehouse over any other sub. Their subs are delicious and made to order. I have two that I switch between 1) Firehouse Meatball sub and 2) Smokehouse Beef & Chedder Brisket.

The biggest difference between Firehouse and Subway is that Firehouse uses REAL MEAT. Not crappy, cheap processed packaged meat. Their meatballs are homemade. The meatball sub is smothered in melted cheese and seasonings. So good! The Beef & Cheddar Brisket has brisket, liquid cheddar, mayo and bbq sauce and will leave you craving this sandwich combination. 

Firehouse was also the first place to have the Coca-Cola Freestyle machines were you can mix your soda with different flavors (I like Grape Mellow Yellow or Orange Lemonade). 

This is definitely one of my favorite ""fast food"" places. I would definitely recommend trying them.",1/11/2013 11:23

The dining room is clean and spacious.  The staff is always very friendly. On this particular visit I had just left the doctor (woke up and could not hear in my right ear) and they were very patient with me while trying to communicate as I did not know how loud I was talking and felt very awkward.   They also accommodated me when I told them that I was going to dash to the Starbucks next door while the prepared my sandwich. 

The good thing about Firehouse is their subs.  My two favorites are the Hook & Ladder and the Steak & Cheese.   Today I had the Steak & Cheese which is a lot like a Philly.  The Steak & Cheese has that meaty, sink your teeth in it sensation, topped with sautéed onions and bell peppers.  This is a hearty sandwich that I find very satisfying.  This time, which I did not try perhaps next visit, they offered mushrooms which sounds like a wonderful combination. One addition I like to do with this sandwich is add A-1 Steak Sauce which really adds a nice zing. 

One thing that Firehouse offers that is kind of an ""in your face"" secret is they have a multitude of sauces (hot sauces, steak sauces, etc.) that are readily available for your selection.  If you are doing a carry-out they offer ""to go"" sauce cups for your convenience (they are sturdy and do not seem to come part easily which protects against those accident explosions that can happen).

Definitely give this place a try.  I think it is good for families and kids.",10/1/2013 15:33

But the price?  1 star at best!

For years now, I enjoyed the FH Italian sub.  It is unique and very tasty.

Their posted menu sizes/prices are a bit deceptive here?  If you order a sub, you get a ""regular"" size at the posted price.  Hungry?  Want a ""large?""

Then make SURE you notice and read the fine print on the menu wall for the $2.50 markup for a LARGE, 12-inch size sub!  This markup used to be just $2, but it increased along with all their other prices.

To conclude, I ordered just 1 large 12-inch Hero sub and 1 large 12-inch Italian sub...

No chips, no drink, no combo - just 2 large subs.  All cold-cut subs, NO fancy grilled cheese-steak stuff, no special ""sub-of-the-month"" and still...  My total was $19.24?  Really?

I know you offer better quality than Subway and other sub joints, that is why I used to enjoy coming here and gladly paid a bit more.  But now?

Geez, I can get a monster Italian sub from Jersey Mike's just minutes SE of here, and for about $5 less than this order.  Plus, JMS always slices their deli meats fresh-to-order, and their mini/regular/giant sub prices are clearly posted!

I used to love FH, but there are many nearby offerings, both local and chain, that make FH's current sandwich size/pricing gimmick seem silly now.

Calling Capt. Sorensen!  This joint almost set my wallet on fire!!

I asked about a few menu items and got stale answers from the young man at the register. I ordered my medium sub, and he just gives me a blank look and asks, ""Is that it?"" I'm sorry, I was giving you a chance to type that in. He never tried to upsell me, he was over it. I got a drink and bag of chips and my total was just shy of $11.

So the young lady starts to make the sub, and a known person to the staff comes in and everything stops and everyone of the staff congregate to this person. I'm being selfish, but I'm on my lunch break and you all have received my $11 for the food. Please make it so I can go back to work...

Ugh...I could have ran to the border, gone to where they got the meat, seen the little red headed girl or should have gone to Publix for better tasting food and service.

Have been to other Firehouse around town, positive experiences. Been waiting for this one cause it is close to where we live. The amount of meat is much less here than we had at another Firehouse. After eating a whole sub, did not feel full.

Contrary to other reviews, the service was great! The cashier was very attentive, explained the menu & told us about their loyalty program.  She checked in on us later to see if everything was okay. 
We ordered the Turkey/Bacon Ranch and the New York  Steamer.  We opted for the meals so we got chips & a soda.  The total was around $20.  The prices are more than Subway,  but it is defiantly worth it! The New York Steamer was great - highly recommended!",6/8/2016 0:57

  I never complain however, our food was so bad I will be personally emailing the businness. Please have your staff understand the subs they are making. One sub was the New York steamer. It had zero dressing tons of mayo :( and no mustard. In fact even sandwiches ordered with no mayo had mayo on both sides. 

The smokehouse brisket meat has good flavor the sub came with next to no BBQ sauce.

Loved the decor too! A tribute to firemen & policemen & first responders, the interior design is cool & fun to see!

I thought another deli sandwich shop...  But it was like being in the twilight zone and i into a New York deli.   The place was vast and clean.   The variety of sandwiches seemed endless with make your own option.   They had a few suggested sandwiches on the menu,  the usual club, tuna turkey.   Then they have their specials like hook and ladder and the engineer...  U have to go there to find out what they are.  They gave me a sample of their corned beef deli and it was freshly cut and delicious.    The club sandwich I had was amazing!   A nice fresh baked it seemed bread with a warm core.  The contrast in temperature gave a curious and inviting flavor to everything....   Hard to describe.   The sauce was sweet yet tangy with a heaping pile of meats nestled between the lettuce and tomatoes.   Just the right ratio of sub bread meet sauce and veggies.   It was truly delicious 
Highly recommend for a new York in Tucson sandwich shop.",5/7/2018 4:33

That's standard operating.

However we got there about 30 minutes before closing, and the Manager, Tim, told us they close at 9. We figured we could wolf down the sandwiches and be out a little after closing.

Well, it took them about 12 minutes to make the sandwhiches. When they were ready, a kid care over and asked if we would mind taking our sandwiches to go. We asked if we had a choice and as politely negative as he could, he said they were really behind tonight.

I HAVE NEVER, EVER, BEEN ASKED TO LEAVE A DINING ESTABLISHMENT AT EXACTLY CLOSING TIME, LET ALONE A FEW MINUTES BEFORE!!! 

I realize these guys are hourly and it was Friday night, but come on. This is your idea of customer service? Faced with the possibility of having to try to eat rather juicy subs in the car, we abandoned the rest of our planned shopping trip and took the food home.

I can't really blame Tim, the manager. Hopefully he has no aspirations toward a successful career in restaurant management. I have to blame the person who gave him permission to bar the doors at 9, or the person who gave him the authority to make the decision on his own.

Next time we're in that neighborhood after 8 PM, we're probably not going to chance stopping in at Firehouse. We'll go to Cane's (in the same parking lot) for some very good chicken tenders. The don't close until 10 or 11.",5/21/2016 2:42

The girl at the register was friendly and took our orders quickly. The guys making the sandwiches were working fast and seemed to have a good system down. I was so excited for my sandwich.

They have a nice selections of sandwiches to satisfy everyone's tastes, and they come in a few different sizes and prices.   I ended up ordering the beef and cheddar brisket sandwich.

I got the combo that included chips and a drink and the price was comparable to other sub shops.
The sandwich was ready fairly quick and i was ready to indulge.

The sandwich was hot and delicious as it could be,  and each bite was as satisfying as the one before, topping off my good experience with flying colors.

The counter service was friendly, and i wasn't rushed when looking over the menu to order,  which is always a nice touch.  Will most definitely return, for hopefully another satisfying experience..",2/15/2017 20:31

I had read a little bit about it and knew that it was founded by 2 firefighters in Florida. I knew going in I would be limited with food options because I just recently decided to try to be gluten free and pescatarian.

Anyhoo, the staff was super friendly and informative and the place was clean.

As for food, I would say this place is VERY limited for non meat eating and/or gluten free people. Which is not their fault or their problem. I was only here to check it out with the bf. The bf had The Engineer: smoked turkey breast, melted Swiss, and sautéed mushrooms, served Fully Involved (which means mustard, mayo, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a pickle on the side). He said it was good but  not great and he didn't seem too impressed. However, I think he is bitter about his recently gained food allergy to red meat and pork. I was stuck with a salad which was fine but nothing to write home about. It was a Chef Salad minus the meat (they did charge a little less for no meat, which is cool): Fresh romaine, iceberg, bell pepper, cucumber, red onion, tomato, provolone, sliced egg, and your choice of: Virginia honey ham, sliced chicken, tuna salad, chicken salad, or smoked turkey breast. It was mostly iceberg. 

They do have a nice selection of hot sauces in varying degrees of heat level.

So this place is fine for a quick and easy bite and definitely worth checking out but with my current dietary choices I will not be seeking it out anytime soon.",1/13/2014 20:07

Instead of the normal styrofoam, TO-GO box procedures are cutting edge. A cardboard-type encasement houses the sub blissfully. Form fitting with room to breathe, stopping the soggy-sandwich effect in its TRACKS !

A bit out of the way for us, but we will make the trip of a place is worth it. 

Well, let me say that Firehouse Subs blew my expectations out of the water! The two young guys working were very polite and helpful, and once we took our toasted subs home, that's when the magic happened. 

I wasn't expecting to look in the bag and not see your typical paper-wrapped hoagie. They were set in individual containers, which kept the sandwich neat and together. It was sliced in half, diagonally (you wouldn't believe how hard it is for some places to slice a sandwich in half!) and everything looked really, really fresh. Upon first bite, I realized it wasn't just for show. This was an AMAZING sub! The roll was perfectly soft, all ingredients fresh, and just the right amount of everything. Even a pickle spear individually bagged! It may sound silly, but I didn't want the eating experience to end.

Went back today. What a wonderful experience.
Food and staff were great. We will be back.


Worst service ever. The pictures on the board of the sandwiches look like nothing what they serve. Almost false advertising.I saw a picture of their bistro sandwich on their entrance door.  It looked great so I ordered one. 
It was awful. Half the size and not not very appealing. When I mentioned it to the staff. They said that is the way it is.   I don't think they even cared. Back to Jersey Mike's I go.

What a difference from a year ago.
Wife talked me into going back. She wanted to try a Brixit sandwich she had heard about.
I reluctantly have in.  The place was clean. The girls behind the counter were friendly and made us very nice sandwiches.
Because of this I will raise my review by two stars. I look forward to my next visit. Maybe I will not wait a year to come back.
10/07/17 Went back today because my wife had a coupon. One sandwich with chips and drink. It was $9.87 with a $2 off coupon. Wow!

I was able to calm myself down and I pulled them out.  Overall, it took about 10 minutes to get the sandwich at the counter (expected). 

Despite this I still give them 5 stars, we all make mistakes.  It was a very delicious sandwich and they seem to be very consistent with their food quality standards.

Usually,  I get either the meatball sub or the Italian sub. I decided to try the Turkey ranch bacon club sub and boy am I glad that I did. It was delicious. I love this place. Their rolls are so soft and they give you plenty of meat, cheese, and toppings. Unlike some sub places , their subs are pretty thick. There's nothing worse than a skimpy sub.

Also, if you have their Firehouse Subs app and you get points towards double meat subs and sometimes free Subs. On your birthday they will give you a free sub. Also, I think the decor is really cute here. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the subs or a little bit small for the price you pay.  But, they are very tasty and it is definitely worth going here if you love subs.  I definitely recommend this particular Firehouse Subs because the employees are really friendly too.",5/19/2017 12:19

Anyway, this Firehouse Subs location deserves more yelp reviews (positive ones, hopefully). I always get turkey. Meat is of great quality and tastes fresh. I almost always get my sub ""fully involved"" minus the lettuce. Full involved = lettuce, tomatoes, onions, mayo, mustard and a dill spear. Toppings/condiments are always fresh too. Also, for you sauce lovers, there are a number of different mild-hot sauces available on the counter to add some kick to your sandwich. This is complimentary. 

Again, I like their deli meat. Turkey is smoked! Not sure whether I enjoy it or boars head more, but that tells you how serious they are about delivering great, quality sandwiches.

For some reason mac and cheese has always come out a little later than the sandwiches though I'm told it only takes less than 3 minutes to make. This time, it never came out. We were done with our sandwiches by then so I asked for a refund. The manager did offer to make the mac and cheese for us, but we were ready to go. He advises he would do a refund.  Interestingly, appears if you pay via ApplePay or Android you cannot get a refund on your card so he had to give it back to me in cash.

Firehouse Subs was started by firemen, and the chain has grown to 600+ restaurants around the US.

The gimmick is that all of their sandwiches are named after firefighting apparatus and job types, and this playful take gives you selections such as the ""Hook and Ladder"" and the ""Engineer"". Be sure to order your subs ""fully involved"" meaning served with mayo, deli mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a kosher dill pickle on the side. The decorations inside the restaurant are photos and memorabilia from firefighters, and the restaurant offers a nice discount for firefighters, police, and military personnel.

Firehouse Subs started a Public Safety Foundation in each city and makes a point of helping the hometown heroes. It's a nice touch that offers funding, life-saving equipment, disaster assistance and educational opportunities for first responders and public safety organizations.

You order your sandwich at the counter -- they have about a dozen different types to choose from. Some may say that's too small of a selection, but I've never found it a problem. Firehouse also offers sandwiches on rolls and a Chef's salad, and a couple of combos for the kiddies. On the front counter you'll see a vast array of hot sauces, and you're encouraged to splash on the heat after you receive your sub.

For dinner tonight I ordered an Italian sub on whole wheat, and of course I asked for it ""Fully Involved"". The sandwich came on a toasted sub roll with Genoa salami, pepperoni, ham, melted provolone, Italian dressing, and seasonings. The bread was toasted and crusty on the outside, and still soft on the inside. Add to that a bag of Miss Vickie's kettle-cooked potato chips and a trip to the always-enjoyable Coca-Cola Freestyle soda machine to mix up the tonic-du-jour, and I was a happy firefighter!

Great place to try something a little different, and donate some extra change to their Public Safety Foundation.",9/9/2013 2:04

Decided to come here for lunch...place wasn't that crowded but began to get a crowd after we ordered.  As we were walking in there was an older man at the counter complaining over something but I totally ignored it and went to the register to place our order.  Ordered 2 hook and ladder combos with a side of Mac and cheese for my daughter.  After we placed our order, we found a table and sat down.  After sitting there for a bit I knew it felt like an awful long time so I looked at my phone compared to the time stamp on the receipt and 18 minutes had already passed! Say what!?  I also happened to notice that there were about 4 people standing around also waiting for their to go orders, as well as a lot of the tables being full.  Sitting there a bit longer, I'm seeing the people behind the cook area sort of arguing and seem confused about orders or something, then the guy comes out and delivers food at the table next to ours which those people were after us in line! I can't believe what I am seeing -- and we are starving at this point along with our frustration as now its been over 20 minutes and no food!  My husband went up to the register to ask how much longer for our food and the clerks all looked puzzled, then tell him that they haven't even started our order yet!!  Are you freaking kidding me.  WOW.  He is beyond frustrated at this point and asks for a refund -- we will go somewhere else to have lunch.  He has to wait for another individual to come over to process the refund then we end up leaving.  I don't know what is happening to this location but although this has been the worse experience here, it's definitely not the only complaint or lack of quality service we've experienced here.  Management definitely needs to look at the reviews and take some action to improve the customer experience.

They have a deal for every day of the week now where you get a sub, chip, and drink for $5.55. Now that they do that they really compete with the other guys that offer deals of the day.

I tell her to stop and ask for a refund.  The manager comes over, apologizes,  and says it's a problem with their order system.  I ask if it is corporate or franchise responsibility, which she says is a franchise responsibility and that corporate had not yet sent a tech to identify and fix the problem yet, though they had already notified corporate.  BIG fail on both sides.  Franchise should put in a manual process if they know something like this is broken.  Corporate should help their franchisee immediately if this was truly part of the process. Either way, if I hadn't checked we'd still be waiting.  I think im done with Firehouse for a while now.

It was served on a toasted white roll.  I ordered a medium--nine inches which was totally shareable and ample for both my husband and me.

I also like that there are low calorie options listed.

I'd recommend maybe a turkey or roast beef next time, since their version of the Italian sandwich was non-traditional; it had a sweeter oil & vinegar dressing and a sweeter ham. I would prefer a mortadella and capicolla on the sandwich, instead of pepperoni and (apparently) honey ham.

The filling was heated, which was nice...it melted the cheese and added flavor to the meat...but after taking it back to the office, the lettuce got a little warm. 
 Service was friendly and reasonably quick, took a little over 5m to make the sandwich, and it was at noon.

I could see going back if convenient, but it's not on my ""top"" list...Jimmy John's is closer to me and pretty comparable.

What's good: Friendly service, selection.

What needs work: Italian sandwich not to my taste; too sweet ham and dressing.",12/30/2014 22:47

Ordered through their drive thru and got a club on a sub and it's supposed to have bacon AND cheese. It came with neither of those things. The sub was so sloppy once I got home, the bun on the bottom was so soggy it was hard to eat. If I ever want firehouse, I'll probably be eating in the restaurant rather than drive thru just to make sure they get it eight

Love firehouse subs! I've been going to firehouse since 2012 in Virginia and it's always been a fave! My ultimate favorite sandwich is the Beef and Cheddar Brisket!! It is the best.

I picked up the sandwich and quickly noticed that this was not like other gluten-free breads that often chew like shoe leather.With my first bite I could tell that this bread was different! So soft, so tasty, it was like an actual homemade roll! I had to force myself to eat slowly so that I could enjoy every mouthful, even though my stomach wanted me to gobble it all down!!

Their subs are very good. My mainstay is the brisket, so I will focus on this one.

If you like Brisket, you have to try it here. Forget about those other fast food places that claim they make the best Brisket sandwich. They don't. Trust me, Ive tried them. 

Arbys, for example, says ""We have the meats"". Well, they do have the meats, but in my opinion, they are not very good meats and their brisket is..well, lets just say based on the taste, its questionable if it actually is Brisket, and I will leave it at that. 

The brisket here is very smoky, but its not a strong smoke flavor like you get from Hickory. I am going to email them and try to find out a bit more about how they smoke their meet and where. 

There is only 1 issue, which is not big , but big enough to costs Firehouse 1 star.

Like I said, I have been going to Firehouse for a long time now. I have probably been here 50 times or maybe more. This has been a pattern that I dont understand. But it happens often enough as to cost them a star and raise concerns.

It would be like spending a dollar to save a nickel. In this case they do great with The Meats, but they skimp on other things, which I really dont get.

On 4 out of 5 carry out visits, they put little to no sauce on the sandwich and they give me few or no pickles, which are supposed to come with the Brisket. So I get lots of meat, which is great, but on a Brisket sub, sauce plays a huge role in the overall goodness of it.

If a Brisket sandwich is short sauce, its like taking a Ferrari, which is 12 cylinder, and making it so it only fires on 6 cylinders. Sure the Ferrari will still run and do a decent job, but its not going to perform near as well as it could if it was running on all 12.

Same goes for their brisket sub. Sure its still good, but its nowhere near as good is it could be because its either missing the sauce or has very little of it.

Its the weirdest thing in my mind. They give me lots of meat most times, but then they short me on the sauce and the pickle. 

I woke up at 3am this morning thinking on this. Weird right? To wake up at the crack of dawn and think about a review you have written and a restaurant you have visited, but as I tell my wife, Welcome to My Mind.

The problem is that on their Brisket sub, they put both Mayo and BBQ sauce. Why Mayo I have no idea. Being from Texas, I hate Mayo with a passion and the combo of the 2 is, in my opinion, even weirder. Even my wife hates it and she was born and raised here in Idaho.

When I order the Brisket sub, I always ask them to leave off the Mayo. When they do, they do not add more BBQ sauce to make up for this. They use what must be the very same ratio of BBQ sauce to Mayo, which is light on the sauce and heavy on the Mayo.

What I end up with is a very dry sub because they stuck to their formula of very light BBQ sauce. So mystery solved. If you like me, do not like Mayo, and order this sub without it, do yourself a favor and ask them to go heavier on the BBQ sauce.

Before I forget, speaking of the meat, they do sometimes have a nasty habit of shorting this as well. I usually order double meat just for that reason. When they do double meat, they usually do give you a ton of meat, but you pay for it. 

The foot-long Brisket is $10 then another $5 for the double meat so this is a bit of an expensive sandwich. But trust me, it is worth it if you are a carnivore like me.

Sometimes their bread is stale as well and a weird texture. Have you ever put bread in the microwave? When you do this, there is a weird reaction that happens at the molecular level of the bread. It becomes chewy, so I am wondering if they are putting their bread in a microwave to warm it up.

So when you go here, which I suggest everyone does, especially if you love Brisket, make sure you get your  sauce and a pickle.",3/1/2019 23:02

Ordered thru doordash and was missing one bowl of Mac n cheese which doordash gave me credit for. The bowl was the size of a cup at any other restaurant so not sure if this was also a mixup or if this was truly their bowl size.
The taste was nothing to be excited about. I've had better from a box as sad as that is.
I got the steak and cheese so like a philly. Tasted and looked like mayo on it, no flavor at all from the meat or veggies. VERY bland ate 6 bites and saving the rest. Will only eat because of the price which was double the price of subway.

Reason this gets 2 stars is because my husband also got a sandwich and he said it was good. His was the Italian and he liked it more than the Wendy's Italian.

There is something special about Firehouse subs. There is definitely more love per bite than your typical lackluster subway sandwich or greasy fast food quick fix. Whats even better is that you are supporting local first responders with every bite, so no need for it to be a guilty pleasure, it is a righteous cause. Many of the sandwiches are hot (duh, made by fire fighters) and they do not disappoint. A coke freestyle machine is available for almost limitless flavors to choose from to put out the fires on your plate should you choose to order your sandwich fully involved.

I normally get their brisket sandwiches, whether the regular menu item or some limited-time version. I've also had the chicken, I think. It's a sandwich my wife normally gets. The steak and cheese sandwich had such a great flavor. I'm not sure if it was the brand of mayo or the combination of the mayo and peppers. And then the steak was chopped up nicely. I didn't have struggle with the meat. 

Anyway, I stopped in to redeem a b-day reward and boy, was I rewarded. My wife took a bite while it was warm and said it was delicious. I had to make a few more stops--Big EZ Seafood, Chipotle, Haydel's, Cupcake Factory--before I could sit and enjoy it. Yes, it was cold by that time and I put it in the microwave for a few seconds, but it was just as good as when I took my first bite earlier in the day.

So coming home a couple weekends ago, I mentioned going to FH for lunch

My dad is a volunteer firefighter, and I immediately already loved the place.
I decided to order the Turkey Bacon Ranch, but with chicken---(i know, i know)
It took a little while for our sammys to come out, but it was WAY worth the wait..
THAT sandwich---- was DELICIOUS-------!!!
I know- i am a lover of deli sandwiches--but this one--- was so good!!!
And honestly, I cant wait to go back---
Not to mention---- get this--- when you walk in-- look in the corner--
It looks some drink machine from outter space--for riz.! 
They have something like over 220 different kinds of drinks you can make..
CRAZY-NESS..! but oh so cool ! 
THey also have a ton of different hot sauces and stuff you can choose from-
my sandwich was perfect, so i didnt need to add anything.
I can now see why my honey loves this place so much.
Beware- its a little hard to find, but its RIGHT next to Bread Co. there in the strip mall... so after a long hard day of shopping, or just out and about-
stop in! you wont be sorry!

Though they weren't busy, I was immediately greeted by the team with enthusiasm. The guy realized I hadn't been in many times and walked me through the entire menu. The staff was fun, conversational, and really didn't mind helping. Everybody just seemed happy and to be having a good day. After my order, they educated me in the different sauces I was thumbing through.. Giving me advice.. Sharing stories.. It was fun! I got my food.. Amazing... Great serving.. Hot.. An employee even checked in on me whine I was eating.. These guys definitely rectified the bad experience at the other location. Great experience for sure. Thanks guys!

When you walk in there's a great hot sauce bottle collection at the counter. That's really cool, I've not seen that and I looked thru all the bottles until my sandwich arrived. I like variety and this had lots of options from A1 to habanero based options, nice, very nice. They also rank them in order of heat 1-10, 10 being the hottest so that helps to take the guess work out of it. Offering this is a great idea and one that allows you to customize your sub and allows you to change it up every time if you'd like.

There was one person who ordered before us and three that ordered after. 15 minutes later, we were literally the only people left in there and still had not received our food. There were four people behind the counter. It took everything I had not to get grumpy with them. And, they never said ""sorry for the wait"" or anything like that. If the place had been busy, I could understand. But, it wasn't. They also skimped on the sandwich in my opinion. Mine was all lettuce and bread and not at all the way the other locations do it.

I visited the Largo mall location to try FireHouse Subs for the first time tonight. Sadly I was VERY DISAPPOINTED. I arrived shortly after 8pm and there were only 2 other customers in the building. The soda machine was flat, and not only was an employee aware of it but also completely ignored the problem. While waiting for my food, the female employee working behind the counter had a conversation with the other employees saying that they needed to get everything done fast so she could hurry up and get out. This conversation was occurring an hour before they were scheduled to close, and loud enough for customers to hear. She also stated that on previous nights she had turned customers away at the door before closing hours so she could get out. After all the fuss about the employees needing to get out early, it still took 10 minutes to get a single turkey sub. When all was said and done, there wasn't even a pickle with my sub which I specifically requested. Needless to say, I was extremely dissatisfied with my First and LAST visit to FireHouse Subs.",7/30/2015 0:59

Fianlly she comes back and actually pays attention to my order, all I wanted to get was an engineer sub, with no meat. Simple, easy. It becomes a delicious vegetarian swiss cheese mushroom sammich. At any other firehouse they have NO problem understanding this. She said the other Firehouse locations have no idea what they're doing. Just literally don't put any meat on it. No, she wanted to argue that it would just be a veggie sub. So that's what she rang it as. I got maybe 10-15 mushroom pieces, no swiss cheese, 70% shredded lettuce and a couple tomatoes. It was like eating 95% lettuce and bread, it was just sad. It took them 15 mins to make it even though there were more staff than customers present.

When we stepped the cashier, she was nice enough to explain their are different ways to order and she could tell by our concussion that we hadn't been there before. 

We ended up getting the meatball, which my son LOVED!!!  Especially since the sandwich is served open face and the provolone is melted onto the side of the bread. So he is under the impression that he's getting two items, a meatball sub and cheese bread. The cashier talked me into the New York Steamer, which I must say was outstanding!  Nothing makes me happier then a sandwich that falls apart and has juice dripping all over the place.  That to me is a sign of a GREAT sandwich. The messier the better. My wife got the smokehouse need and cheddar brisket, I'm assuming she loved it since she wouldn't let me have a bite. 

Also the crazy soda fountain. My son thought it was futuristic. So many ways to create your own soda, and loved that it was a touchscreen just like an iPad.

I had a coupon...that also helped.

My wife and I walked in right before a HUGE lunch rush. We got in, ordered and sat down before the cattle drive moved in. I ordered TWO sandwiches because...well I was just plain hungry. Haha! The ambiance was entertaining, and the fire department lingo used in the order process made my laugh.

I had a brisket/cheddar sub and a turkey club sub. Both were top notch. I also had a bag of chips, nothing special there, but they are chips...who doesn't like chips. I see this as a cheaper, but more tasty, alternative to Quizno's. I am a long standing hater of Quizno's, mostly because the exuberant pricing and mediocre taste. I was kinda glad to see them go around St. Louis. This is better, but still more pricey than Subway or Mr. Goodcents. The subs are a bit small, I even ended up finishing my wife's and I was still a bit hungry after almost three medium subs.

Today, I was annoyed, as the man who came in after me and ordered a sub to go was given his food before me - by the only gal (out of at least four employees there) who was making the sandwiches.

It took TEN minutes to get my medium turkey sub. TEN. I checked in on Yelp when I arrived and it was literally ten minutes until my sandwich arrived. 

There was one couple sitting down when I walked in. They were almost finished eating. And literally no one ahead of me. I don't get it.

No worries though as management comped us two drinks while they prepared the order. The soda machine is not to be missed as it blends any of the coke products with most every flavor you can imagine. I had coke zero raspberry. The Sammie's arrived hot and yummy. The hot sauces are an interesting twist. Tried one rated 4 on 1-10 hotness scale and it wasn't hot at all.

At the office yesterday, we all decided to go try it out.  The place was packed out the door by 12pm, which is probably due to the place being new.  Everyone loves a new restaurant by the Pyramids!

It was hard to see the menu and wait in line to order for the food.  We waited for almost 30+ minutes before the food arrived at our table.  Based on observation, it appeared they were servicing all the to-go orders before any of the dining patrons first.  The server was very friendly and apologetic for the wait and try to do everything he could to make us feel at ease.

I ordered the Engineer Sub with a pickle on the side.  There was no pickle on the side.  There was supposed to be spicy mustard, but there was none on my sandwich either.  The presentation of the food was also not the most appealing; my turkey and tomatoes were not under the bread, but tossed on the plate.

Overall, there were kinks with our experience, and it's understandable due to it being a brand new restaurant.  The restaurant was opened by firefighters, so it seemed really cool to be able to provide support; therefore, I will try it again.  Hopefully, by then, the kinks will be ironed out, and there will be another great sub place to eat at for lunch.  However, based on my current experience, I can only give it 3 stars, but hopefully, my updated review will provide more stars.",5/27/2010 17:26

I have tried many varieties of their hot sauce which they have sitting out for anyone to use. They have all kinds of crazy names for the hot sauces and the employees tell you not to use more than a toothpick dip worth or it will burn your mouth. 

So with me liking very hot sauce I took their advice and tried some, and like most places there hot sauce failed my heat test. I had to use a lot of their hottest sauce in my chili to spice it up. But I understand for the average customer they can only make sauce so hot. 

So aficionados of extreme heat will not be satisfied with their sauces no matter how scary of a name they give them, lol. The sub sandwiches tasted better than the cheaper franchise subs but not as good as some of the other more top-of-the-line sub shops.",2/15/2016 23:59

I am rating a sub shop, not  comparing  Firehouse  to Kemoll's, this is a sub sandwich shop to other sub sandwich shops I have been to review. That said, if I were a franchisee of Subway, I would start to worry if a Firehouse Sub is opening anywhere near.  While they don't serve hamburgers, if I owned an Arby's or Lion's Choice, I would be looking over my shoulder to see who is gaining on me.

There are currently 10 locations, and I have only been to the Chesterfield shop in the Forum Shopping center (at the northern terminus of Woods Mill was, before they rebuilt it).

Squeeky clean facility, but I don't understand the economics of building a one holer restroom in a brand new fast food restaurant.  Lion's Choice made the same mistake at their new shop on Clarkson.  The problem is if a gent forgets to lock the door, the second man in exposes the first guy hanging out......

Ok let's talk about sandwiches.  You name it they either have it as a standard offering with a cute fireman's lingo like ""Hook & Ladder"" or you can combine any meats and toppings you want, with a wide variety of meats.  They have a 500 calorie menu, a tuna option for non-meat eaters, and a vegan sandwich.

Here comes my only complaint....Don't call it a ""New York Steamer"" piled high with corned beef and pastrami, and then slather mayo on it.  Pull that trick in NYC and you will be out of business in a minute.  I did not think to order my ""Steamer"" with only mustard, although I could have.

Other than the mayo, my ""New York Steamer"" was hot, juicy, and had a lot of meat on it.  Unlike Subway which is spotty at best, they lavish on the ingredients.  

The young folks working there were friendly and nice to deal with.  They were patient with us, because as new customers on our first visit, the menu was enormous and making a selection difficult.  My wife had something with turkey on wheat, and really enjoyed it.

I honestly don't know what Kristen S. ate, but my meat was tender, juicy and favorable. The large sandwich is quite a handful.....They have a sauce bar if you want to add flavors to your meal, and they thankfully put a ranking number on the bottle so as a customer you don't get shocked by a habanero based product.

The Coke machine is worth going to this shop, to see what a really smart company does to demonstrate their product.  It was really interesting to see all of the various options.

Totally an enjoyable quick meal...We will return and are super pleased that they opened near our home.",9/10/2015 0:52

I arrived around dinnertime.  There were several people already dining, but the line was nonexistent.  I ordered the King's Hawaiian special, which had 12 hour smoked pulled pork, cole slaw, pepperjack cheese all on a King's Hawaiian roll.

The sandwich was ready very quickly, and it came out hot and delicious.  The pulled pork was very flavorful.  This is a must try item.  I was able to finish it without any leftovers, so you may consider getting the combo or something additional to eat if you are extremely hungry.  

I will definitely be back.",9/3/2015 0:11

They advertise the brisket as having been smoked 16 hours at a Texas smokehouse. I have been a judge for the Kansas City BBQ Society, and can tell you that the brisket was better than 95% of the contestants I have judged.

The coke machine is worth a visit in itself.  I don't want to spoil the secret, but it is more fun than the coin machines seen around, and gives you exactly what you want.

Conveniently located along Olive and near highway 141, Firehouse Subs can easily be seen from the main road. There's plenty of private parking in the shared lot in the front, and the venue is pretty quiet despite being near a busy street. 

I love the concept of Firehouse Subs and the charity it backs. The story behind the chain always tugs at my heart, which is why we make sure to visit from time to time. The subs are nothing out of the ordinary, but will for sure satisfy any hunger you had. Be sure to check out their collection of hot sauces and try a couple on your next sub! We have a good time rating the ones we like. :)",3/8/2019 20:36

When I got it home it had many extra ingredients that were not specified when I placed the ""build your own"" order.  Our guest did not take one bite out of his nearly $10 sandwich because it was not what he ordered.  We called back to the restaurant and spoke to the person who took the order (who we are on a first name basis with because of our many visits). She said they automatically make ""build your own"" sandwiches ""fully involved"" which includes mayo, deli mustard, lettuce, tomato & onion. The order I placed was for a meat and cheese only sandwich. She then put the manager on the phone.

It was after 2 p.m., so there weren't too many people in the house.

They say, ""Welcome to Firehouse Subs"" to every patron who walks in the door. They're not looking at you; their eyes are down. It's kinda muttered and extremely unenthusiastic.

They should either stop doing it or do it much better.

The order-taker explained that all sandwiches are served hot. He told me the most popular sandwich overall (Hook and Ladder), and the most popular sandwich in St. Louis (Beef and Cheddar Brisket).

I asked specifically about the chicken salad sandwich, and he told me all the ingredients. I confirmed that there was no sugar in it. He said no, but there's black pepper and a little curry.

I ended up with a to-go Momma's Chicken salad sandwich ($6.26 with tax) from the ""Under 500 Calorie"" menu: small-diced chicken, pecans, green pepper, Swiss, tomato and light mayo on a light wheat roll (495 calories).

He asked if I wanted a pickle spear on the side. That was the most exciting question I was asked today.

When I got home, I found the pickle spear (dill) beautifully wrapped in a recyclable plastic bag that precluded pickle juice from getting to the sandwich. Brilliant. And it was delicious.

The sandwich was well-wrapped and secured with a little sticker.

 The light wheat roll had a great, nutty flavor. I think there were two tomato slices on the sandwich along with the other ingredients, but I didn't taste the pecans. And I didn't taste curry.

The bigger disappointment was the texture of the chicken salad. The chicken seemed nearly ground. It was too mushy and needed some gumption.

I would go here again, but I would not get the chicken salad in any form.",7/2/2015 1:09

Until tonight.

I live down in Tampa, but my son had a football game in Spring Hill, so after the game, we all saw the newly-opened Firehouse and decided to grub down on some sandwiches.  There is a Firehouse that we frequent in Tampa and the service and subs are always top-notch, so we were licking our chops as we pulled up to the store!

I guess the first mistake I made was not paying close enough attention to the time.  We walked in around 8:40 and placed our order at 8:45ish.  The store was surprisingly busy, so there were quite a few orders in front of ours.  We grabbed our chips and drinks, then sat down and waited for our order.  When they called my name, I went up to the counter to retrieve our vittles, which was packed up in bags.  I asked the guy, ""Don't you usually serve these in baskets?""  ""Oh, you have to take the order to go because we're closed now,"" was how he replied.  So I told the kid that I was from out of town and had no place to eat the sandwiches, so if I couldn't sit down and eat, I'd cancel the order and request a refund.  And this is where the magic happens.  The store manager, identifiable by his black shirt and name tag that read ""manager,"" chimed in and said, ""You can't have a refund because the order is already made.""  I told the manger, ""Had I been advised at the time I placed my order, I would have simply gone somewhere that I could eat.""  His reply was, ""That's not my problem.""  At this point, I was flummoxed and at a loss for words.  So I went to grab the food, and he sighed heavily and said, ""Go ahead and sit down to eat, but hurry it up.""  So I turned around, looked at his name tag and said, ""You're the manager?  Dave Harris?""  And he said, ""Yeah that's right.  Do it!""  As if he was daring me to file a formal complaint.  As I was walking away, I heard him say to another employee, ""What a jerk!"" For real???? I seriously couldn't believe this guy.  I mean, where the HELL did Firehouse find this assclown?  Did he manage the soup nazi's joint on Seinfeld?  What store manager of a newly-opened location would speak to paying customers like that... with that tone? Wow.

After next week's football game, I can tell you where I'm *NOT* dropping $40 on food!

Side note, as we were rapidly scarfing down our sandwiches, one of the younger employees walked by and said, ""Sorry about that.""  He should be promoted to manager immediately.",11/2/2011 3:00

The meatball is good but wish the roll was a little better as it doesn't completely secure  meatballs making for a messy sandwich as the balls pop out with each biTe lol.

They always try to greet you with a cheery welcome. The dining room is clean although kind of small.  I think the only downside to the location is the placement of the 120 flavored soda machine (great idea with limits) which is located almost directly in a position that hinders the ordering line.  This is inconvenient and confusing since people wanting refills wind up in the ordering line or those getting refills block the ordering line.  Not to mention people seemed to find them confusing (almost like watching someone use an ATM for the first time) which takes more time and also backs up the line.  I am not sure what this location could do about it because as mentioned above it is small.

The good thing about Firehouse is their subs.  My two favorites are the Hook & Ladder and the Steak & Cheese.   The Hook & Ladder is a great sandwich that blends flavors that give a sweet and tangy sensation with its combination of smoked turkey, honey ham and cheese topped with mayo and deli mustard.  Which is good combination by itself but when the onion kicks it there is an explosion of flavors.  The Steak & Cheese has that meaty, sink your teeth in it sensation, topped with sautéed onions and bell peppers.  This is a hearty sandwich that I find very satisfying.  One addition I like to do with this is add A-1 Steak Sauce which really adds a nice zing. 

One thing that Firehouse offers that is kind of an ""in your face"" secret is they have a multitude of sauces (hot sauces, steak sauces, etc.) that are readily available for your selection. 

Definitely give this place a try.  I think it is good for families and kids.",9/29/2013 12:57

I signed up to firehouse subs for my birthday, currently I am waiting on the parking spot for drive thru only, but it has been roughly 15 minutes since I ordered my sandwich. I don't see many people inside, about 4 others. This is my very first time ordering from this establishment and I'm already given a long wait time for my first time, what a great impression right? While I'm I'm at the drive thru window, my order was a brisket & cheddar sub, but it took about 4 minutes just for the attendant to tell me they ran out of brisket, I asked for a recommendation & they told me steak & cheese would be the next best thing so I listened and substituted that instead. I'm currently still waiting for my sub as I've received no updates and during my drive thru, there was another car that received their order quicker than mine, I'm curious on what's taking so long. I also noticed an employee just casually walking back and forth with their cell phone taking a call, could the service be any better?

edit: I received my order after going inside after writing this review, there was 5 people working the counter and one shouting employee who I assumed to be the manager, he was really nice and generous, but the reason why my sub was not delivered earlier was because they had given it out to the wrong person, that same shouting person gave a speech on communication to his co-workers and how they should listen more, everyone who was a regular worker looked lifeless, and put to shame but didn't seem to care, once again, great manager, poor communication from team members, it took about 32 minutes roughly before receiving my order and finding out it was given to the wrong person, there was also another customer who came back in and returned their order, it was probably mine but they received the wrong order as well, they were in the drive thru I'm assuming, if management could work on this store, it could definitely be potentially a better store, with new staff members of course, I believe the manager was in the right of doing all the shaming and scolding, I appreciated that my patience didn't go to waste",1/27/2019 0:02

There is really not much for anyone to review about the ""Firehouse"" chain of restaurants.,all we can say is that the same sandwiches are as insipid and uncrafted as they come.

I've been to other Firehouses and they were great. This location seems to expect(and encourage) you to be a takeout order when you walk in. As soon as you walk in, they ask ""togo order?"" or even maybe guess a name based on orders that have been put in(as I observed while I was sitting and eating).

I like to eat in Firehouses(opposed to togo) since their sweet tea is amazing and can have the sub right when it's freshly made. I got to this location around 5pm and their tea urns were empty(sweet and unsweet). I asked if they could make more sweet and they said ""aww man some guy just came in and took it all. Huge togo order"" and I could hear snickering from the other coworkers.. guaranteed they were lying and just didn't feel like making it nor making me anymore. So they offered me some unsweet from the drivethru area and gave it to me in a cup packed full of ice and if you've ever tried to sweeten tea packed with ice, then you know where this is going... it was just blah. And at this point, if I asked them for a new cup with little or no ice, they would've likely shut down the store because what I was asking was just far too much.

A detail that I noticed: I've been to a few other FH's in the area and they're short-staffed, usually only 2 employees. There was a solid 5 or more employees so it's not like they were just slammed and couldn't help me; they all very clearly did not WANT to help me

And I sort of expected this last part, but even though they asked 'here or togo?' and I said here, they put it in a togo bag and when I said it was for here, they acted like it was this HUGE inconvenience for them to get me a basket to put it on",12/18/2021 23:40

I am a hard core hoagie biggot, so I was afraid I was bout to be hosed when I saw their Italian was served with Mustard and Mayo. I decided to jump without a net and order the combo, just the way they make it, with the House Special Cherry Limeade, served with real limes from a too cool for school soda dispenser. My buds all got the Hook and Ladder. A couple of us ventured into the signature hot sauce collection to turn up the heat.

Service was snappy, prices and just about everything else were about what you expect from a franchised toasted sub experience. I ate every bite of the sandwich, and while it was no Italian Hoagie, it was a pretty good lunch, and I will go back for sure, if nothing else, just to be yelled at when I walk through the door.",5/1/2012 22:41

The sandwiches that we got, were hands-down, THE BEST sandwiches that we have ever eaten. I really was pretty speechless about how good it was and so were my friends. I got the #10.

I rarely ever need to go out to Malvern for anything, but now I'm dreaming up reasons to make the trip and stop for lunch.

At 2pm, service was slow. I expect to wait 15 minutes during a lunch rush for a sandwich but not in a nearly empty place. 

When I finally got the food, the corned beef sub on wheat was decent if not overwhelmingly good.  Definitely better than Subway but I can't expect them to compete with a local hoagie place. They load it up with mayo and cheese which satiates the part of the brain that enjoys saturated fat.  The steaming adds a nice touch to the overall texture.  The lineup of hot sauce bottles to choose from is a bonus. 

The chili was Wendy's quality, which is to say it tasted fine but really isn't worth more than 99 cents. So for $3.89 it's far from a bargain. A little too watery for my tastes, though flavor-wise it wasn't bad.  It probably could have benefited from a combination of 5 of the hot sauces.

The only problem is that it's very expensive comparatively, the menu obfuscates the prices so you wont know what it all costs until you order. Two large 12"" subs for us was 17.50, you can get 5 or 6 dollar large subs at Wawa and Subway but they're  half the girth that Firehouse subs are. Firehouse subs taste way better than twice as much so it's worth it, but if I went here every day I'd go broke. I get the Turkey Bacon Ranch every time, I'm scared to buy a new sub cause then I would be missing out on getting my TBR again. :(

They also have the Coke Freestyle machine in there, so if you wanna go nuts trying out soda combinations then there you go. But really, a soda and a large sub there is gonna be 10 dollars so be ready.",6/6/2014 7:19

The pricing is cheap for most places you'd go for lunch but a little on the expensive side for a sub shop.

The food and service are both decidedly mediocre.

As for the food, the cold hoagies are usually slathered in mayo and mustard to the point that the roll falls apart in your hand. Be sure to grab extra napkins if you get your sandwich ""Fully Involved"" (with everything on it) as they suggest. The rolls themselves are bland and doughy, a far cry from the traditional chewy, flaky Philadelphia hoagie roll. The hot hoagies I've tried suffer from the same over-slathering issue, with cheese and condiments rendering the bun soggy and limp. The taste? Just okay...about as good as any other hoagie after it sat in the fridge for a day.

As for the service, don't expect anything timely or efficient. I was the only person in the shop recently, and it still took 15 minutes from ordering to get my sandwich, that is, after the employees bickered over who was going to make it. If an employee has no interest in actually doing their job, he or she shouldn't be there. It is no wonder the employee who reluctantly made my sandwich got my order wrong while arguing with his coworkers over who was going to work the late shift. I was ignored while they complained about their hours and duties. Customer service was severely lacking, even with nobody else in there but me.

I know most people will say they don't care and it's delicious, which is true, but please keep that in mind when ordering most sandwhiches here. I decided to go with the Hot Pastrami sandwich the second time, which was around 1000 calories for the 12 inch, and it was a major dissappointment. I probably won't be returning as often unless I am looking to pig out that day, because it seems their best sandwhiches are the ones I wouldn't want to eat a couple of times a week for lunch.

I'm skeptical, but my curiosity to try a new place so close to home quells the apprehension. 

The Good: My bf ordered the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket - this was very good albeit a wee bit salty for my taste. I had two bites to be certain. 

The Bad: I ordered the Turkey Bacon Ranch on wheat. I'm really sorry, but they didn't really do any better than Subway. The bread was soggy, despite the fact they were economical with the Ranch dressing. The bread nor meat were of the best quality. The whole sandwich was the same texture. 

The Ugly: This place is competing with Primo's, Jimmy John's and every pizza shop from City to Shore. Unfortunately, I don't think they can compete in this dog fight. 

The bf reported that the decor was a lot like Jimmy John's discerned by the Firehouse theme (Dalmatian statue and gear on the walls) and a bar with an extensive array of hot sauce. 

For 2 large subs, a bag of chips and one drink, the bill came in slightly under $20.

I ordered the Turkey Bacon Ranch sub, with an order of chips and a soda.  The sub was big enough to share or to have as another meal.  It filled me up quite fast.  They have a Coke Freestyle machine that has an amazing array of drink choices.

Bottom Line:
Friendly owner, Uncharacteristically Decent Chain Food, Clean Operation.

Overview:
Since March 2016, I have been sporadically visiting this location for lunch carry out orders. I typically order online and tailor my order specifically how I like it. That is part of the reason I order online. Anyway, I have never ordered from any other Firehouse Subs location, so I have nothing to compare this to as far as their other chain locations go. I do like the concept that they support first responders. 

Food:
My favorites here are:

Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket:
This is my go-to sandwich. The Sweet Baby Ray's BBQ sauce uses cheap High Fructose Corn Syrup versus sugar. Because of that, I request the BBQ sauce to be left off. Out of the roughly 10 visits this year, only one time have they sent me home with BBQ sauce on the sandwich. Otherwise, I add black olives and mushrooms (an upcharge). I should request onions to be added. That would help this sandwich out.

Hot Pastrami or Corned Beef Brisket:
There is not much to say on these two sandwiches. The meat is decent and something nice to pick when I am not ""feeling"" the Smokehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket. 

The sandwiches do not stand out in any unique way. They do serve them ""Fully Involved"" which I think means you get tomato, lettuce, onion, mayonnaise, and mustard. Those are all fresh and help the sandwich.

Chili:
The chili is decent for a chain. It has ""body"" with beans and meat. It is a not a ""liquidy"" chili. The crackers they offer with it are not your typical cheap-o saltines. I need to find out if they would be willing to add cheddar or chopped onion. It would certainly help, along with maybe some jalapeno or some other additions.

Catering:
I ordered the ""Sub Platter"" for a recent charity bingo event. Of course, they tailored the order to how I wanted using both white and wheat bread. Some nice surprises for me were the inclusion of a gallon of their sweet tea, as well as a lemon cookie. After ordering the sweet tea, I will be getting that again! I did not get to sample the lemon cookie, but I hope to try it in the future.

As a side note, I found the owner, as well as the employee, Hailey (sp?), to be quite helpful during the catering ordering process. They helped me via email and by telephone.

Parking and Location:
This particular restaurant is located in a strip mall that has private lot parking. I have found it to be a very crowded lot, and you have to hunt somewhat for a spot.  

One day, I noticed a girl walking back from the Mobil station on the corner lot to where she worked (she was dressed in something formal) in the strip mall. I asked her who all these cars belong to. She said that the salon in that strip holds mostly their customers. Then in the evening, you have a total of three restaurants competing for space.

Online Ordering and Rewards Program:
The computer systems for customers at Firehouse Subs could use some help. The online ordering system is separate from their rewards system. Oh, and their rewards system has separate web and smartphone applications that are separate and do not share data. Perhaps these are results of growing pains. When I spoke with the owner of this particular franchise location about the issues I have experienced, I was told they are supposed to be making changes to their systems by year end.

One More Thing:
At this location, they have a Coca-Cola Freestyle machine. I rarely get to use it because most of my orders are ""to go"", and I am not a big fan of lugging a soda around. Regardless, it is a bonus in my mind, and just one more incentive for me to continue coming back.

Summary:
As much as I am not a fan of chain restaurants, the convenient location and the unique offerings at Firehouse Subs brings me back time and time again. Online ordering is a huge plus for me, as well.",6/18/2016 17:45

Unfortunately the pickings were very slim (at least 25% of the sauces were gone) (I took a pic, but can't see how to share it).  I asked a gal cleaning and she said they have been out for awhile.

I realize good workers are hard to find, but you can do better. 

While there I watched a gal making our sandwiches stop and leave the line and refill straws wearing the same gloves, leaving our sandwiches out on the line. The trash can was out and empty and other diners asked if there was another trash can to dispose of their trash from eating.

Ultimately, firehouse is a bit pricey, they seem to go a bit skimpy on the meat, and the subs are not that big in the first place. Generally speaking, most Firehouse establishments probably do not deserve more than 3 stars, this place was so new, so clean, and working so hard to do everything perfect, that I was convinced they deserved an extra star.

Every-time someone walks in the staff says, "" Welcome to Firehouse,"" which is nice and unexpected. You will wait a little longer to receive your sandwich because this is not Subway!

I only have experience with their meatball sub, (so far) which is outstanding and filling. I would rate their meatball sub better than Cosseta, and is little less (including tax) price wise for a 12"" too. The only thing is the bread could be a little better, they should use more like a baguette. 

Plus, the Firehouse meatball sub puts a hearty helping of cheese on top and marinara sauce too and red pepper flakes can be requested. This is NOT a run-of-mill  'iffy quality shop like other sub shops, Firehouse is top notch in my book and very good. 

It has one of those Coke fusion machines if that is of interest to you,too.

Firehouse was my go-to sandwich shop in college, but it has found a way back into my heart now that I live a mere half mile from the one on Kennedy. If you don't prefer hot mayo (I get it, everyone has their ""things""), you can simply ask them to prepare a ""cold"" sub - but their hot subs are where it's at! 

My only qualm about this particular location is that they tend to be a little on the slow side. But to get around that issue, I just place my orders online ahead of time through Firehouse's corporate website, and voila - sandwich is ready upon my arrival (usually anyway)! 

I like that all of their subs are fully customizable, as I am incredibly picky. I despise spicy mustard and they never mind subbing it for yellow mustard. I also get my subs with light lettuce and light onion, and it's just perfect. 

You can get a large sub for under 10 bucks - and if you're thrifty like me, enjoy your chips and soda at home instead of opting for a combo meal... OR spend the extra couple bucks and enjoy a fountain soda from the giant self-service soda machine near the grab and go station. 

Dining in or taking out, Firehouse is a great spot for an affordable, delicious meal - and it is WAY tastier than other fast food sandwich chains such as Subway *blegh*.",1/7/2018 21:39

I've probably had about six different types of sandwiches here and I do like how many options I have to customize additional ingredients at no additional charge. 

While I usually come here at off hours when there is clearly not a lunch rush, the guys making my sandwich get to it and I don't mind waiting a few minutes for them to get it right...especially if I'm ordering something from the hot side of the menu.

The value of getting just the sandwich is very good considering every receipt seems to come with an online survey which produces a code that takes care of the medium drink on every subsequent visit. And I love the Cherry Lime Aid option at the machine.

I do wonder why so often my order is rung in by an employee who doesn't seem very good at doing it. Almost every time, the guy who ends up making my sandwich has to look over the shoulder of the employee taking my order and offer assistance. Sure, I could understand training somebody now and then, but my ordering experience almost always seems to have an awkward moment or two. 

However, the end results are usually tasty and the restaurant is consistenly very clean.",10/14/2014 1:43

While I appreciate the unique fire fighter theme and donating money to local fire fighter stations, I have to agree with Yelp Elite Todd because I can't say I've ever had a decent sub sandwich here. The decor of firehouse subs is red brick with firefighter art all over the walls, with black and white dalmatian style counter-tops on all the tables. There is a covered patio for outdoor seating, a huge selection of hot sauces, a large indoor area with many tables, and 1 TV with the baseball game on. 

After placing my order at the register, it took 10 minutes to make my sub, which was surprising considering there was no line at the register, just people waiting for sandwiches, and a whopping 4 people making sandwiches. I got a $7 Philly cheese-steak sub and they forgot the cheese! It's in the name and they forgot it! The lady tells me there's cheese on the bottom. I ask her to point it out and she can't, so she puts a slice of cold un-melted cheese on top, and doesn't offer to heat the sub up so that the cheese is melted. First of all, who would put cheese on the bottom? Everyone knows cheese goes on top of meat. Have you ever seen a burger with cheese on the bottom or spaghetti with cheese on the bottom? Second, I notice they forgot to put mayo and mustard on the sandwich as I had asked. I have to get up again to get a side of sauce. Then I'm looking for the tomatoes and lettuce and finally notice it on the bottom of the sandwich instead of the top as it normally goes. Firehouse staff made my sandwich totally backwards! I then realize that Firehouse staff did not include peppercinni's on the side as I had asked, but I did not want to get up a 3rd time from my meal, so I didn't bother asking for them. With no melted cheese and my meal interrupted twice due to kitchen staff's mistakes, the Philly steak was quite lack luster. I really should've had them remake the sub with melted cheese but I didn't have that kind of time during lunch. 

On another occasion, I had the smokehouse beef and cheddar brisket which the lady highly recommended as Firehouse's best signature sandwich but it ended up having way too much sauce and turned into a fairly inedible soggy soup sandwich with chewy meat unfortunately. 

If anything tells you how sub-par the subs are, Subway is hands down far better than Firehouse and that's a real shame because Firehouse advertises themselves as a premium sandwich shop. In fact I can't name a sandwich shop that makes worse sandwiches than firehouse. If you are craving an awesome Philly cheese-steak, I recommend skipping this place and either going to Wawa's or Jersey Mike's!",5/1/2017 18:22

So I recently went to this location for the first time as it is on the route I take to get to work via MTA bus. I was deciding on the surrounding restaurants and I felt burned out from them. I noticed this nifty looking sub shop and decided ""Why not? Been a while since I had SubWay.""

But this place is so much better then SubWay by far. It's cleaner, the food is fresher, it's hot and they've got a good selection of product. One of the best things about this place is the Coca-Cola Freestyle drink machine, while it's a little bulky and not as streamlined as I'd like, it was still awesome. Over 120+ drink selections and a wide variety of flavorings you can add makes this machine worth checking out.

Now, as to the reasoning behind the 4 stars? Well, one of the associates there seemed like he could care less about the guest aside from just taking their order and moving on. He had no personal touch, it was almost as if he were robotic and programmed to just take orders. It's associates like that that really annoy me. Obviously if you want people to return they'd do it not only for the food but for the workers, too. It makes the experience that much better. Now the manager there (noticeable by the collared shirts they wear) was very nice, talkative just right, and attentive to my needs. The second time I went there (because it was such a great atmosphere) he remembered who I was, which always means a lot to me as a consumer.

But most certainly someplace to check out if you ever want great, hot food, several drink choices, and a cozy, hip atmosphere. Think twice about going to SubWay over Firehouse or you may regret the hesitation!

I checked this place out for lunch. About 15 types of subs to chose from. The subs are steamed. Hmm, never had that before.. The smallest size you can order is a medium cause well all firefighters know smalls are for wimps.

As you're waiting for your sub to steam, you can choose your 'hot' sauce to put on your sub. There are about 100+ jars of hot sauce to chose from with numbers to indicate the hotness (#10 being holy hotness). That is the niche of this place. The Hot sauces. 

They bring your sub out to you and as i finished I said to myself, 'ah it was okay, i probably will never come back. I've checked it off the list"" ... The place was clean, service was nice but i won't be telling you omg that place is on fire its so awesome.

I'm really racking my brain here trying to come up with a negative, but nothing comes to mind. The bread is delicious and the meats... oh man, the meats. I've tried just about every one on the menu now and the story is the same across the board - they are all delicious and absolutely dripping with flavor - literally, dripping, I tell you. I guess that comes from the steaming process (And yes, I do realize how all this talk about dripping meats is probably opening up some gross sexual images in some people's minds). Though despite the juiciness, I've never had an experience with soggy bread like one other reviewer said... maybe because the sandwich is so delicious that I inhale it within minutes.

1. Sub was tasty and reminds me of Quiznos.
1. Price point is still high and there is a lot of local competition even as a fast casual. Because the price point is high it reminds me a lot of Subway's business model for franchise owners.  Most of the gains will come through the sale of chips and a drink.

They have a good selection of other hot subs, although it is hard for me to order anything but the roast beef and cheddar.  They also have several chopped salads which my wife enjoys.  They also have a kids menu which includes a drink, treat and a fireman's hat, all for a fairly affordable price (under $5 i believe).

They make sandwiches fairly quick and I have never had a problem with order accuracy on what is delivered.  The serving staff are nice enough as well.

On my last visit they were somewhat forgetful on an item which accompanies the kids meal - mainly the fire hat.

I just wasn't impressed with Firehouse. I found this location to have a weird setup and everything was all over the place. You order in the corner and when you go to get your drink you basically have to turn around and walk directly back into the line you were just in to get your drink. It can get very cluttered especially if multiple people are getting refills. 

I ordered the ""hook n ladder"" sub, which I'm assuming is their ""specialty"" sandwich. It's the first thing on the menu, its got a firefighter theme, and well, lets just say I'm assuming this is their specialty sandwich. You get the point...

I ordered that along with a medium combo for just over nine dollars. The medium drink was huge. Anywhere else it would be a large. So when I got my cup and saw how big it was, I was excited for my sub hoping it would be rather large. 

It took about 5 minutes for them to make my sub, which I found a little long to toast some bread and put some meat together but oh well. 

Finally my sub came out and it was a lot smaller than I imagined. I don't know if I got unlucky or that's just how small their subs are, but it made a foot long from Subway look big and that's not saying much.

Now it's impossible to pick up a correct order.  Impossible.

After one particularly bad situation, I contacted the mgmt and was just given excuse after excuse.  Apparently, if you enter an order correct online and they screw it up, it's slightly more your your fault than theirs.

Today, we were out and about.  Since we were nearby, I ordered from the mobile app.  We had to wait 15 minutes past our pick up time (35 mins total) and they jacked up both sandwiches.  It was comical because as we were eating, I looked at P and said,  ""I think I have your bread and toppings.""

The Firehouse Hero is also really good and served ""Fully Involved,"" which means mayo, mustard, lettuce, onion and tomato.  

You know what else is really good here?  The salads!  Yes, I know.  They are very fresh and served with crisp green pepper, red onion and hard boiled egg.  They're very good and they'll throw some meat on them, too.

I remembered they have a few unique options like the steamer. I saw that they had chili as well as the subs. As it was around 20 degrees the sub and chili sounded good. I ordered a small engineer which is smoked turkey sub with mushrooms and most of the other standard ingredients. I like the warm subs here. Also they have the coke freestyle which is a big plus. I have a theory with sub shops that I followed never go through the drive through. It's way to complicated to get what you want even being inside. They do offer on line ordering with pickup too. Inside was very clean and well adorned with appropriate fire house theming. Another big plus is they actively donate to help fire fighters. Always good to feel like your helping out while you eat. The sandwich was great my only drawback is I realized I should have ordered a larger one. The chili is not spicy at all but still tasted good. I also got a cookie to eat as they had chocolate with mint chips which was good to. I didn't have any issues during my visit and the speed of getting my sandwich seemed appropriate.,2/11/2021 0:06

Plenty of searing, clean area, has a nice open atmosphere. I like how the decor reflects the imagery of a firehouse. Metal chairs though are a lil uncomfortable and cold. It's not gonna keep me away though.

If you haven't, you're in for a treat.  Keep in mind that these aren't poboys.  They aren't less tasty, they're just different.

The bread isn't as good as Jimmy John's or Panera Bread, but it's a lot better than Subway and Quizno's.  They do a lot of sandwiches well, and you can always custom build your own, but as far as I'm concerned, the Firehouse Hero is where it's at--roast beef, smoked turkey, Virginia ham, and provolone melted on top.  I get it ""Fully Involved"" (fully dressed, plus mustard and onion), slather some Captain Sorensen's Datil Pepper Sauce on that baby, and drift off to seventh heaven.

Pickle comes on the side and it's tasty.  If you're going Large, and you like pickle, order an extra pickle.  The combo is of questionable value in my book, but if you're gonna get a drink anyway, just get the combo.  I like Doritos, but they have all the national brands of small-bag chips, and their baked goodies are as good as Subway (or better, depending on the item).

I go here about once a month, and I've noticed that the tables can be a little dirty AFTER the lunch rush.  I think the employees are tired and a little off their game after the rush, so as the volume drops off, they aren't as good about the wipe-down and refresh.

It was so bad that honestly I am never coming back and I have no doubt in my mind that this place is going to go under in near future if things continue on their current path. 

We came in as soon as they opened, so 10:30 am.  No one welcomed us, we were just met with blank stares. Whatever, we ordered two large sandwiches, one Steak and Cheese and the other was Brisket and Cheddar. It took them over 20 minutes to prepare two sandwiches. There was only one person who had ordered ahead of us, so I have no clue why it took that long to make two subs. There were at least six employees there, so staffing was not the issue. We eventually get our sandwiches, and they were terrible. They did not toast the bread, our sandwiches were made incorrectly and the quality of the meat was poor. To make a bad situation worse, both my husband and I experienced stomach pains within an hour after leaving. This was literally our first meal of the day, so there is no question as to what could have caused our discomfort. I'm just happy our toddler did not eat anything while we were here, so at least he was spared feeling ill. 

Believe me when I say that you're better off going to Subway or any place that serves sandwiches for that matter. I would avoid this place like the plague, unless you enjoy bad food prepared by poorly trained employees. Eat here at your own risk!",1/26/2020 19:14

The thing that was bad was the service - when i went inside the manager and an associate were talking loudly to each other and just continued as if i was not there.  only after about 5 minutes did someone actually take the order - and the other associates didn't look nor act professionally or customer friendly

I had to pop it in the microwave. I will say that the bread for the sub was really fresh and soft though. I will give them another try one day. 

For now, it's just okay.",3/14/2020 1:44

It's bittersweet because Firehouse reminds me of Quiznos in its prime; although, I think Quiznos was superior in quality to both of these delis. Tsk, tsk. 

I love Firehouse's steak and cheese sub. It is my go-to sammich. It amazes me how they put the right amount of mayo every time and I love me some mayo. Now, on this most recent outing, my sandwich was lukewarm and I don't understand why. I picked up my free medium sandwich, by the way, thanks to T-mobile Tuesdays, drove to the nearby mall and parked. That took all of...two minutes? My sandwich had the temperature of a sandwich that had been sitting for 10 minutes. Temp aside, the bread was pillowy soft, the steak was well seasoned and the peppers were on point. The medium is pretty filling too.

Service was great and fast. Of course, there weren't many customers because of Covid, I imagine. But it was another opportunity to support a small business.",12/17/2020 22:49

We didn't have time to dine in, since we had a sleeping baby and cold food in the truck- so this review is based on our take out experience. 

Matt ran in and ordered a large Firehouse Steak and Cheese for us to share, although they had lots of tasty options on the menu (I'm talking about you, Firehouse Beef & Cheddar Brisket). While he was inside, I noticed that if you check-in on Yelp you can get a free cookie! I called Matt in a hurry and to fill him in on the Yelp swag and he managed to check-in and snag one before they finished making our sandwich. I'm so glad he did because their cookies are absolutely delicious! Not too hard, not too soft and filled with lots of chocolate chunks- what's not to love? We devoured our cookie on the ride home, and couldn't wait to dig into our sandwich. Well let me tell you, the Steak and Cheese did not disappoint. The bread was perfectly toasted, and the steak was thin and well seasoned. It also had an excellent ratio of steak to bell pepper. It held up extremely well on our 10 minute drive home, so I can only imagine it would be even better if we had the chance to dine in. 

Matt reported that the service he received was very friendly and that all of the employees greeted him when he arrived. One of my favorite reasons for giving this chain our business is that a portion of their proceeds goes towards first responders! This is  such a wonderful cause, and one that is close to my heart as my grandfather was a firefighter. These individuals put their lives on the line everyday to help other families in need, so I love contributing to organizations that give back to those who serve our communities. 

I encourage you to give Firehouse Subs your business if you're in the area. There is also a special they are currently running- $4.99 for a medium sub! So there is no better time than the present to try them out!",7/24/2018 13:48

For a chain sandwich shop, Firehouse Subs is actually really good!

Upon entering, you see a very, very clean space.  All the tables were clean, the floors were clean.  The decor was decent, the lighting was good.  Overall, it's a very inviting space.  They have the ordering and pick-up lines clearly labelled, so understanding where to go was simple.  It was made even easier by the very friendly employee that greeted us at the door.  She explained some of the sandwiches and pricing, and gave us some of her favorites as recommendations.  

The sandwiches we chose were the Hero and the steak and cheese, both on the white bread sub roll.  The Hero has roast beef, turkey, and Virginia ham, and all were extremely moist and tasty.  And the sandwich had a lot of all three, making it a pretty substantial sandwich.  The cheese didn't have a ton of flavor, but the rest of the sandwich was so juicy and the bread was so soft and fresh, that I didn't mind.  The steak and cheese sandwich was great!  The steak was the shaved type typical in Philly cheese steak sandwiches.  It was quite flavorful and good.  The peppers still had a bit of a crunch, adding to the texture of the sandwich.  Surprisingly, the mustard that comes on the sandwich was also very good.  I'm from the tri-state area and have had quite a lot of cheese steaks in my time.  The idea of mustard on one was a little odd for me, but we tried it anyway, and it worked!  Overall, these were two very good sandwiches.

Also kinda cool, Firehouse has a Coca-Cola freestyle machine.  Oh my!  The amount of fountain drink options in that thing is mind boggling!  We tried their cherry limeade, which was basically very sugary cherry flavored stuff, but it was ok in small quantities.  You have to squeeze a lot of limes in it, though, and I added some water in mine to cut the sweetness.

Our table was cleaned up for us very quickly by the nice lady that greeted us upon entering.  They really cared about cleanliness and making customers comfortable!

The Italian is good as long as it is hot but the flavors fathers when it cools. It could be served hotter to prevent that. The of the other subs are tasty as well but they could use more meat and cheese. The variety of meats and cheeses are certainly a plus.

But the kids love Firehouse and the parents like it, too. Plus, they have a drive-through lane so you can call in your order ahead of time and drive through to pick it up. I literally just changed my rating from 3-star to 4-star for that feature, alone (again, a very nice feature for a family with young kids that can be challenging to get in & out of the car).

The space itself is clean and bright, and they offer one of those drink dispensers that have 20934820358 options of soda.  They also have an iced tea station - both sweet and unsweet teas.  I did a mixture - 70% unsweet and 30% sweetened for a perfect (for me) ratio.

Both times I got the Engineer with chopped pickles added.  I chose to get the wheat bread option, and it was delicious.  Great chew, fluffy, and light all at the same time, and sturdy enough to hold up all of the meat and toppings that they pile onto the grinder.  The toppings (tomatoes, lettuce, etc) are fresher and a higher standard than what Subway uses.

The first time we ate in the restaurant itself, the second time we did take out to eat at home.  The sandwiches definitely hold up better if you can eat them in the restaurant, mainly because when you take a hot sub to go it is bound to get a little soggy in the wrapper.

I'm intrigued to try their online ordering system - if it works well I will definitely utilize it as the subs do take a little longer than the average grinder place to come out.",6/1/2015 4:02

Almost all the sub sandwiches (with the exception of a few sandwiches) are hot subs.  You can get 8"" or 12"" sandwiches.  Most combos are about $8.20 which includes chips and a drink (from the Coca-Cola freestyle machine).  I loved the sweet and smoky barbecue Ruffles chips. 
 My favorite sandwich is the Italian on honey wheat.  The deli meat is hot, and the toppings are cold.  It is recommended to eat the sandwich right away or else it will get mushy even with the thick bread.  I know some Italian sandwiches are too sour from the vinegar, but it has a great taste with the Italian dressing and spicy mustard.  I highly recommend Firehouse Subs.
If you need your sandwich made in less than 10 minutes, I would say to call your order in and take your car to the pick-up window.",12/22/2012 7:22

My girlfriend wondered aloud about the sizing, and all three employees ignored us until I explicitly asked. Our food didn't take much time, though I would have waited longer for a meal with more care. Our sandwiches were haphazardly thrown in the bag. I had the club, which looked good, but all I could taste was mayo and sweetness. The honey ham overpowered the entire sandwich. The bacon was wet and limp. It seemed microwaved. My girlfriend's New York Steamer was a mushy disaster. It tasted like a microwaved gas station sandwich.

The coke freestyle machine is awesome but that place was too buy to just have one machine, even if they did have another machine I'm not sure where they would put it. If you have an undecided person or a newbie to the coke freestyle machine, you might be there for a while.

I didn't get the welcome to the firehouse like other people have said. I ordered the hook and ladder with chips and a drink. My daughter ordered the salad with the sliced chicken on top. It was sliced lunch meat not a sliced chicken breast like I thought it was going to be. My daughter and I shared the sandwich and salad. Make sure to ask for a cold sub if you want that, they are all served warm. The hook and ladder was better than expected and the chopped salad was good too. My ice tea was very good. My daughter got a vanilla coke and she said it was good. 

Oh, they do have an employee to bring your sandwich out to your table. They have firemen hats for the kids. If I'm in Tucson again visiting family I would definitely go again.

With his sub my husband wanted the chili. $3.69 for a cup is not bad, but not great either. The cup was half empty. I noticed a man one table over eating his chili and his cup  was full. The server said they were ""rationing"" it  as they were low. I asked for the manager. The manager came over, told me the half cup was acceptable to her but would bring us more ""when it was done"". Never came. Needless to say we just ate and left. Chili was mediocre anyway.

They should have refunded our money if they could not fill the order.   My husband loved his Meatball Sub. My Chicken Club sub was nice but bland. No spice, no sauce....bland. So we will not rush back any time soon.

Firehouse is my favorite chain sub shop in Tucson. The large sub is huge and meaty! They're very clean and the product is consistently tasty. I wish the meat were a little less like the thin, salty, grocery-store style slices. But for hot subs they beat Quiznos any day. Ooh, and you can order online.

NOTE: On the way into this store there was a couple who had never tried Firehouse and I was selling them on this place and now I look like a fool!

I am extremely upset and disappointed that the guy before me who was dining in had to wait for a second sandwich to be made because his was screwed up. I get home and as you can see by my proof of purchase I paid for extra bacon and no onions and this clearly is not what I paid for!

When I referred him to the menu (you know, the menu where you work...) description of a Plain Salad, he acknowledged that it should have tomatoes, cheese, peppers, cucumbers, etc. He apologized & said he can't fix it because he can't contact the Grub Hub driver. That isn't true! While we were reviewing the order, I noted that the contact for the driver was right there. He didn't want to do that. When I requested a refund of the $6.99, he said talk to Grub Hub.  I told him that is horrible customer service; it would take several days to get my money back. I suggested they re-make the salad & deliver it to me, even if he had to send an employee.  All I got was a sorry, after being repeatedly told there is nothing he can do to fix it.

Now back to... pastrami. I recommend getting ""fully involved"" with your pastrami sandwich here. Which is to say it would be the aforementioned pastrami tucked in that nice, soft, fresh bun underneath a blanket of provolone decorated with mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion and a pickle spear on the side.

We were both hungry enough to chew on our wallets that day, so we were looking forward to some great sandwiches.

We ordered the smokehouse beef and cheddar and the chicken salad sandwiches to go. After seeing the pictures, and again reading reviews, we were drooling on our way back home (less than a 5 minute drive). We got home, opened up our sandwiches. We each tried both sandwiches. After two bites, we stopped, looked at each other and said ""What?"" The bread was dry. I don't mean toasted, crunchy. I'm talking multi day old bread that was dryer than the Rillito River bed outside of monsoon season. And this was on both sandwiches. We've both been to Subway and Eegees (okay sandwiches, nothing to write home about), but compared to those places, these Firehouse subs were sandpaper. Okay, maybe it was a bad day. We'll try again.

Fast forward two weeks later, we tried it again. This time, we tried the smoked turkey and the premium roast beef. Same issue. Bread as dry as California's drought. I don't understand. This place has amazing reviews. What am I missing? I talked to a neighbor who swears by the place and he informed me ""you're doing it wrong."" Apparently, we needed to take our sandwiches around the corner from the pick up and douse them in the selection of hot sauces. Otherwise, as my friend said, ""you get a dry, bland, pretty lousy sandwich."" So, the claim to fame is the hot sauce selection?

I know others on here have had great experiences with Firehouse Subs. Good for them. And please, don't take my word for it. Try them yourself. I may have the palette of a goat.",6/5/2015 1:15

This location is the opposite of everything that is wrong with Brandon Blvd. Service is friendly. Food comes up FAST - 5 minutes as opposed to 20. The store is neat and tidy. They get my order right. They give me time to punch in my phone number for the rewards, instead of racing to try and beat me, forcing me to submit my receipt via the app. Staff members come out to check and see if everything is okay, if you need anything, or see if they can take your tray for you.

Firehouse subs is where it's at!!! 

My first introduction to FS was the free medium sub that they give for your birthday. (Keep that in mind when your bday comes along). I got the beef and cheese (Philly cheese steak)sub. It was great! Amazing flavors! 

A couple of weeks later and I've been here 2 days in a row during my lunch break. I only have 30min lunch break so if I didn't bring lunch I would go to tacobell, wawa, even order in for a pasta bowl at dominos. But I was sick of those places. Then I remember firehouse subs was right there! My break is usually at the time it opens (10:30) I come in at 11. With only 30min, I need a quick meal. FS is efficient and quick. They are not sloppy when making my sub. Importantly, QUICK! The wait is no longer than 8min.

 I'm greeted by the employees welcoming me with bright smiles! 
The menu is just mouth watering. From meatball subs to their moist chocolate chip cookies. 

I'm usually just staring at the menu. I have yet to try a sub that disappointed. The average medium sub meal that comes with a drink and your choice of chips, cookie, or Brownie. Is $9.40! Not too bad in my book! 

They have the coke variety machine so mix and match your favorite drinks and flavors with your meal. This is my new favorite lunch spot. Forget the rest and take a chance at FIREHOUSE SUBS!",5/28/2016 13:26

I'm a big fan of Firehouse Subs overall and the sub (The Fully Involved Italian) did not disappoint

Having said that, however there are a few things working against this Firehouse:

First, the parking is absurd. It shares with several business and at least one of them has an angry sign telling you not to park there for Firehouse. It's not a big lot either, so it is not easy to find a spot.

Second, the woman who took my order looked at me, and everyone else exactly like she'd be much happier if we all went to some other location for lunch. I don't expect to be greeted like I'm the greatest customer of all time, but looking like you wish I was dead is a big turnoff.",9/20/2017 20:03

I should give it a 5-star rating but I don't pass those out easily unless a place really hits home and does a fantastic job. Another great thing about Firehouse is that it has really fast service 9 times out of 10 (barring any busy hours). I also really like the wide variety of sodas because they have the Coke Freestyle machine which, surprisingly, offers Pepsi products as well.

At any rate, I digress. This place was great, hot, fresh, fast, and fairly convenient and my only wish is that there was one closer to my house but still, taking a trip out that way is worth it. Beats Jimmy Johns, beats Subway by far, and beats Jersey Mike's.

My husband had a cheddar/brisket sub with bbq sauce. It tasted WONDERFUL but the meat portion was far too small. I had the chicken salad sub which was only okay taste-wise. It was bland, but the meat portion was really generous. I can say that I really did like the texture of the whole-wheat bread.

I think they were bugged at some lady who was before me, but c'mon dudettes, let it go. Don't take it out on the rest of us.

When my order was finally taken, it was as if I was bothering them just speaking to them. At one point I began to wonder if they were being robbed and the assailant was hiding in the kitchen. They all seemed so morose.

Food was great, though. Better than Subway, waaay better than Jersey Mikes. That's where the one star comes from. Minus four stars for the service. The guy who made my sandwich was nice, soooo, okay, one more star. But that's it.

Well, I did notice they treated the guy after me with the same contempt. So let's go back down to one star.

Sometimes, you just need a good sandwich.

I've made that statement many times over my 47 years of life.  

When I need that sandwich, and I'm not home in Philadelphia to get a cheesesteak, I go to Firehouse Subs.

Why?  These are real sandwiches.  Not that so called ""sub"" from that the place that puts sub in their name.

My go to is the BBQ Steak and Cheddar which is freaking delicious.  But you can't really go wrong with the other subs which have real quality meats.  The fact they're heated just adds to the quality.

I have never been to a Firehouse subs. A coworker ordered online and asked me to pick it up. I again had never been there or ordered online. When I walked in the door I saw a sign for ""to go"" orders so I went there. I waited several minutes and no one greeted me so I waved my hand and said hello to get someones attention. An employee looked up and walked over like I was annoying him. I explained I was there for an online order. He pointed to the bag and rolled his eyes and said its right there. I said is that everything he said yes. I grabbed the bag and began to walk out when another man said ""HEY HEY HEY you need to sign the receipt"". I said OK and signed it. I walked out and drove back to the office. When I get there my coworker noticed that chips and cookies were not in the bag. I called the store to tell them and they said you were supposed to grab them. I told him I asked if the bag I had was everything and you said yes. He replied yes that was all your sandwiches. You are supposed to pick them out yourself. I said why dint you tell me that when I asked if this was everything? He said you should have known. I said I wouldn't know cause I am a new customer. He repeats to me several times that everyone knows and I should have known. When I get back to the store I ask where do I get the chips and cookies and he point to the rack and says over there. I say OK what do I put them in? He huffs and turns around and grabs a bag and flings it at me. I gather my chips and cookies and leave. Just know, I will never eat at a Firehouse Subs again. I called corporate and they are informing the owner (which by the way manager refused to give me contact information for). The food was even that great. I only ate it because work paid for it and by now I was starving from driving around for over an hour back and forth to their location.

This particular day took me over to the Berry Hill area.  My sub sensors zeroed in on Firehouse Subs as a lunch stop and an opportunity to appraise another sub machine shop!.

Well, from my point of entry, the staff smiled and greeted me, despite their obvious  focus on preparing sandwiches. (Score #1.)  Fun decor with a great soda fountain and reasonable table layout.

They permitted me a minute to focus on the menu  (Score #2) - which offered multiple enticing and commonsense selections and combinations,

They offered good insight and suggestions on the sandwich choices, without over selling (Score #3).  I selected The Engineer Sub® (smoked turkey, melted Swiss and sauteéd mushrooms).    Good choice of fresh breads, too.

I was able to directly observe their preparation and steaming of my sandwich.  Refreshingly, I didn't have the uneasy feeling that I get when watching my Subway sandwich being thrown together...nice!  (Score #4).  I was also pleased at the numerous choices of sauces, ranging from mild to ""Shut the Front Door, that's HOT!""  I sampled several and all were very good (Score #5).

Finally, the noise level in the place was not unbearable, making the dine-in experience pleasant.  I did not feel in a hurry to get outta there (Score #6).

Let's face it:  the Firehouse scored all over my card!  I have yet to experience better.

If you're a condiment whore, this is the *only* sub shop for you. Especially if you like actually spicy condiments. They have about 80 different sauces up there, if I'm remembering correctly, that you can grab and sprinkle to taste on your sandwich.

They have a mix-your-own-Coke machine, in which you can create many different flavors of beverage off of a touchscreen. When I looked up that machine, it appeared there were only 3 within a 25 mile radius, Eh, I'm a sucker for gadgets that make flavors of yum.

I would probably be a fan if not for an exchange with an employee that left me uncertain whether I had been insulted or if he was not understanding the question or if he was just high and that's why it required 3 people to get the wrong answer.

Eh, it's a sub shop, it's good, it's more expensive than it should be but if you want condiments selection galore, it's where you have to go.",1/9/2012 20:06

I thought that this place would be a good, healthy and fast lunch option.  I was wrong on at least one count.

I tried the turkey bacon ranch sub combo.  I asked for it with lettuce and tomato, no mayo or mustard.  Sounds pretty simple, right?  Apparently not, as the cashier did not hand me a cup for my drink until I asked.

After about 15 minutes of waiting, I finally received my sandwich.  It was fine.  Someone forgot to add the ranch dressing, which did make the sandwich more healthful, but also made it rather dry.  There was nothing especially memorable about my sandwich.  The turkey tasted like all fast food lunch meat, the bacon was like fast food bacon (thin, soggy, anemic), and the bread was only okay (I do like that it was toasted, though).  I will say that the pickle on the side was crisp and refreshing.

Add the 15 minutes waiting for the sandwich to the 5 minutes I waited to give my order, and this was hardly a fast meal.

The one that my wife ordered, beef and cheddar brisket gave her food poisoning. And she had to stay home from work a couple of days to get over it. Tonight to give insult to injury I went there with the receipt in hand and asked for our money back! We wanted a return on just the one sandwich that made my wife sick and phone numbers to the general manager of the store and the regional manager for the area. The shift leader said no problem. And went into the back. She called the owner a Sarj Patel, who she stated owns that location. She gave the phone to me for when I asked about this situation he said that he would have to turn this over to the insurance company, that he couldn't give back our money!  The least he could do is return our money!  After all my wife went through, and  the work she missed he could have a least given our money back!

Just stop for a second and realize how awesome a hot, toasty sub is with melted cheese and all the fixins....mmmm. Now, imagine the normal amount of sliced meat and DOUBLE it.

I could have gotten past that if it had flavor.  It was one of the blandest subs I've had in a long time.  I'm honestly not sure how you can mess up a sub.

This was a cheat meal that's leaving me wanting more.  I will have to pick up some macaroons from the mall to make up for this disappointment.

I ordered a medium sized Italian sub, which was a perfect size for me. I was pleased with the amount of meat on the sandwich. It kind of had a sweet flavor which was different. It wasn't the best sandwich I've ever had,  but I'd like to go back to try a different sandwich.

Personally, I try to avoid Yelping about franchise restaurants...but I just can't help myself.  The sandwiches here are so damn good.

I love this sandwich shop--and that's saying a lot.  I have pretty high standards with sandwiches, and franchise stores usually fill the void of ""I'm hungry, need food"".  However, with Firehouse, I find myself looking forward to my next sandwich there.  So far, I have been here four times since they opened, and each visit is preceded by a 15-minute gaze at their online menu, trying to decide which one to take home.  There's probably something wrong with me...but I don't care.

Great sandwiches, excellent service, and a quick turnaround during a lunch hour.  Also, if you are a fan of hot sauces, Firehouse offers a terrific selection of bottled hot sauces, each one ranked 1-10 in order of spiciness.  

I also am a fan of their cool Coke machine which has dozens of flavor combinations.

CHOICES!  So many choices at Firehouse.  Eat here.  Judge for yourself.  But from one sandwich guy to another, it's a pretty tasty sandwich.

The ONLY drawback is location.  Leaving the parking lot of Firehouse to get on Dorsett can be a bitch turning left...but it hasn't deterred me yet!

Ugh. 

What I assumed were two female managers had a tiff in the middle of my order. It involved the order right before mine and a big deal was made over whether or not onion should be on someone's sub. 

Typically, service is hugely friendly and efficient, though the above drama (and tone of the woman taking my order while speaking to her co-worker) prompted me to ask her if they were siblings. 

She said they were not...I replied that the way they spoke to one another sounded like they were. 

A short time later, after my food arrived, a customer appeared and though greeted with the usual, ""Welcome to Firehouse!"" cheer, apparently no one was at the register. This prompted the aforementioned Faux Female Sibling #2 to call out, ""Cashier...cashier...cashier..."" until Faux Female Sibling #1 appeared. 

I've been here several times over the last few years and have never seen this type of behavior. Totally inappropriate to let whatever is between the two of them seep out not only in front of employees (what a morale booster), but in front of guests. 

The food is always delicious, however, if this pair is on stage next time I come in, I'll  turn right around and head for the St. Charles Firehouse locale or hit the new MOD Pizza down the block. 

As well, the iced tea machine needs a thorough scrub-down and/or that SCARY WATER SPOUT appears to need replacing (see pics).

The inside of this place is much bigger than any subway or Penn station that I have visited. One thing I did like was they give children a plastic red fireman's hat which I thought was kind of cool.

A drink, sandwich and a bag of chips would roughly cost about $12 which in my opinion, is high for a sub sandwich.

Well, what really upset everyone in the restaurant is this guy was yelling and cussing very loud.  Well, not only did the employees call police, but this guy did to for whatever reason he thought necessitated the call.  Well, the manager was outside in her suv when the police pulled up and they all went outside to talk.  Well, the manager and officers came in and the guy got a sandwich with a smile...amd was able to eat there in the restaurant.

The lack of good veggie options ruined this visit for me. 

There is a veggie but it's weird. It is supposed to be three cheeses with sauteed onions and bell peppers. What it was, it looked like, was a bag of onion slices with cheese and a lot of liquid. The guy who took it out of the heater box drained the liquid for a good 5 seconds there was so much. Then just piled all the onions on to the bread. I asked for cucumbers and they came cubed. So what I got was a liquidy onion sandwich with odd chunks of cucumbers. What the heck is this!?

I ate the sandwich. I like onions so it didnt kill me. But I've never eaten that many onions at once and never without something else. It would have been better to just go with cold onions and peppers with veggies like Subway. There was no avocado either. 

I'm not a fan of the veggie and won't go here again for it. 

PS: look, I don't care if someone is cussing. But when you are like 2 feet from customers you ought to avoid ""Motherf***er"" etc. I'm not sure what the dude was struggling with when making the sandwiches but that was unprofessional.

Its not quite as good as Jimmy Johns to me, but its considerably better than Subway. My biggest complaint seems to come from the soft moist buns. They made my sub collapse under its own weight.

I went on a Fall day when some people coming from working out, soccer games and shopping were getting their sub fix on. All the subs looked very good and I wanted to try all of them. Was not ready to be too adventurous so got the turkey bacon ranch which is Smoked turkey breast, Smithfield® bacon, sharp cheddar cheese topped with peppercorn ranch, mayo, lettuce, tomato, and onion. The Italian Genoa salami, pepperoni, Virginia honey ham, melted provolone, Italian dressing, and seasonings and what they called Fully Involved. This means all in with with mayo, deli mustard, lettuce, tomato, onion, and a kosher dill pickle on the side. They wrap the pickle. Also had the Fire House hero, this had roast beef, smoked turkey breast, Virginia honey ham, and melted provolone and also had it fully Involved.. They were GOOD. So good, I wanted to eat 1/2 of each but they were for friends. I did get to sample theirs. Bread is warm and soft and easily hold-able. Meaning not to mushy and not too hard. Some places are proud of their breads that are really crunchy, but that can hurt the top of your mouth if your not careful. The meats are tasty, not like others that have NO flavor. These sandwiches have substantial taste. Easy parking, fun type of soda machine with different flavors. I drink tea, but it looked interesting. There was someone going around cleaning, so the place was well kept. Food took just a few minutes and I was off. Next time around I am going to try the Engineer. Smoked turkey breast, melted Swiss, and sautéed mushrooms also fully involved. Wish I had a picture, we ate them too fast. Go get you some.",12/15/2015 14:31

Plus I'm always willing to try new sandwiches from wherever. I found this place located in the half-dead strip mall along Homer Adams Parkway in Alton. Very attractive name, so why not? The workers were friendly and very helpful in choosing what was most popular (the Hook and Ladder (#1) was most popular with all locations and the Smokehouse Brisket one (#10) was popular locally. I decided to go with the latter, and I took advantage of the add-ons. They have the same kind of chip selection as Jimmy John's, which wasn't too bad. They have the Coke Remix machine, but for some reason all the drinks came out tasting like crap (Alton flouride, anyone?). Even their exclusive drink, the Cherry Limeade tasted so weak. The sandwich was okay, nothing special. It didn't taste any different than all the other places. I do like the big hot sauce selection they offer for the patrons. As a hot sauce lover, I was digging it. But for some reason, I wasn't that impressed with the food. Especially for how much I paid. Oh well.

Pulled it apart to find a tiny spoonful on each half-- absolutely laughable amount of filling! I order this sandwich regularly and it's NEVER like that. He took it back and asked for a remake,l. The assistant managers said ""it's our portion size"", and never apologized or offered either a refund or a remake. So $7 for a teaspoon of tuna, and apathetic response from the employees... you ARE KIDDING ME!! Customer service standards and quality need an overhaul in this location.",12/4/2020 21:28
